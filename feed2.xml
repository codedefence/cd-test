Your remote access tool is now an unauthenticated entry point. 🔓

CVE-2026-1731 · Severity 9.9 · Pre-authentication RCE in Remote Support.

We’re seeing unauthenticated attackers use crafted WebSocket messages to execute commands directly on your management servers. No credentials or user interaction are required for this to succeed.

Our peers at @GreyNoise and @CISA confirm active exploitation is happening right now. If you use self-hosted @BeyondTrust appliances, you must assume unpatched instances are already compromised.

*The uncomfortable truth: The tools we use to secure our perimeter are often the most targeted backdoors into the heart of the network.*

→ Apply the official security patches released by BeyondTrust today.
→ Audit all management server logs for unauthorized "site user" commands.
→ Restrict management interface access to internal VPN ranges only.

Have you confirmed your on-premise Remote Support version this morning? 👇

A single visit to the wrong website now compromises your laptop. 🛑

CVE-2026-2441 · Severity 8.8 · First actively exploited Chrome zero-day of 2026.

We're seeing @Google rush an emergency fix for a memory flaw in the CSS engine. Attackers are currently using this to run malicious code the moment your users load a compromised page.

The team at @CISA is monitoring this as it allows hackers to hijack active sessions. In a world of SaaS, a compromised browser means a compromised enterprise identity.

*The uncomfortable truth: Your sophisticated EDR means nothing if your users are working in a browser with an unpatched memory leak.*

→ Force-push Chrome version 145.0.7632.75 to all enterprise endpoints.
→ Audit for outdated browser versions still active in your tenant.
→ Require a browser restart for all staff to apply the memory fix.

Does your IT team force-restart browsers or let users click 'Later'? 👇

Attackers are harvesting the souls of your personal AI agents. 🤖

3,016 · OpenClaw skills analyzed with hundreds exhibiting malicious behaviors.

We're seeing a transition in infostealer behavior: from stealing browser credentials to harvesting environment files of AI agents like @OpenClaw. These files contain the API keys and authentication tokens that define your digital identity.

Reports from @BleepingComputer confirm this is the first time malware has specifically targeted agentic AI secrets. Attackers are now moving horizontally through your automation workflows.

*The uncomfortable truth: As we integrate AI into our workflows, we are creating a new, unmonitored attack surface for identity theft.*

→ Audit all local environment files for hardcoded AI API keys.
→ Move AI authentication tokens to hardware-backed secure enclaves.
→ Monitor for unusual outbound API traffic from developer workstations.

Are you monitoring the API keys stored on your developers' local machines? 👇

If your firewall management is public, you are the target. 🚪

CVE-2024-55591 · Severity 9.6 · Authentication bypass in FortiOS.

We’re seeing persistent exploitation attempts against @Fortinet management interfaces exposed to the internet. Attackers gain super-admin privileges to modify policies and establish tunnels into your network.

Over 1,500,000 targets were identified globally for this specific bypass. If you haven't hardened your administrative access, you are providing a platform for the next breach.

*The uncomfortable truth: A firewall with an exposed management interface is just a platform for an attacker's next move.*

→ Disable all HTTP/HTTPS administrative access on the public WAN.
→ Rotate every administrative password on your Fortigate devices today.
→ Patch to FortiOS 7.0.17 or higher to close the auth bypass.

Have you verified your firewall firmware version in the last 24 hours? 👇
