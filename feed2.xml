Your remote access tool is now an unauthenticated entry point. 🔓

CVE-2026-1731 · Severity 9.9 · Pre-authentication RCE in Remote Support.

We’re seeing a surge in scanning activity following the release of a public exploit for @BeyondTrust. Attackers are now bypasssing all credentials to execute commands directly on your management servers.

Reports from @GreyNoise confirm that state-linked actors are already probing for this flaw. If you use on-premise Privileged Remote Access, your most sensitive credentials are at immediate risk.

*The uncomfortable truth: The tools we use to secure our perimeter are often the most targeted backdoors into the heart of the network.*

→ Apply the official security patches released by BeyondTrust today.
→ Audit all management server logs for "site user" command execution.
→ Restrict management interface access to internal VPN ranges only.

Have you confirmed your on-premise Remote Support version this morning? 👇

A single visit to the wrong website now compromises your laptop. 🛑

CVE-2026-2441 · Severity 8.8 · First actively exploited Chrome zero-day of 2026.

We're seeing @Google rush an emergency fix for a memory flaw in the CSS engine. Attackers are currently using this to run malicious code the moment your users load a compromised page.

The team at @CISA is monitoring this as it allows hackers to hijack active sessions. In a world of SaaS, a compromised browser means a compromised enterprise identity.

*The uncomfortable truth: Your sophisticated EDR means nothing if your users are working in a browser with an unpatched memory leak.*

→ Force-push Chrome version 145.0.7632.75 to all enterprise endpoints.
→ Audit for outdated browser versions still active in your tenant.
→ Require a browser restart for all staff to apply the memory fix.

Does your IT team force-restart browsers or let users click 'Later'? 👇

Your trusted email accounts are being turned against you. 📧

$2.9 billion · Total global losses from Business Email Compromise last year.

Our clients are reporting a new wave of Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) attacks. Attackers are stealing session tokens from @Microsoft accounts to bypass MFA and live inside your mailboxes.

We're seeing @Mandiant report that these actors now use your own internal SharePoint links to spread payloads. They don't need to break in; they just steal an active session.

*The uncomfortable truth: Traditional MFA is no longer a silver bullet when attackers can simply clone your active login session.*

→ Revoke all active session cookies for high-risk executive accounts.
→ Implement FIDO2-compliant hardware keys for your finance department.
→ Audit your tenant for new or suspicious inbox forwarding rules.

When was the last time you audited your O365 third-party app permissions? 👇

If your firewall management is public, you are the target. 🚪

CVE-2024-55591 · Severity 9.6 · Authentication bypass in FortiOS.

We’re seeing new ransomware groups like Mora_001 weaponising @Fortinet flaws to gain super-admin rights. They aren't brute-forcing; they're walking through a documented authentication gap.

Attackers are now creating hidden administrative accounts to maintain access even after you think you've cleared the breach. This is a battle for the very foundation of your network.

*The uncomfortable truth: A firewall with an exposed management interface is just a platform for an attacker's next move.*

→ Disable all HTTP/HTTPS administrative access on the public WAN.
→ Rotate every administrative password on your Fortigate devices today.
→ Patch to FortiOS 7.0.16 or higher to close the auth bypass.

Have you verified your firewall firmware version in the last 24 hours? 👇
