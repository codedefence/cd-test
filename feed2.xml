Your firewall is blind to the packets your admins authorized. 🛡️

CVE-2026-1122 · Severity 9.8 · Critical authentication bypass in core edge gateway firmware.

We’re seeing attackers bypass identity checks on @Cisco ASA devices to gain full network persistence. Our clients are asking if MFA protects them; in this specific case, it does not.

Attackers are now moving laterally within minutes of the initial edge breach. We've verified that the exploit script is circulating in closed forums tonight.

*The uncomfortable truth: Your perimeter security is a single point of failure if you haven't implemented internal micro-segmentation.*

→ Patch all edge security appliances within the next 24 hours.
→ Audit your VPN session logs for unusual source IP locations.
→ Rotate administrative credentials for all network gateway devices.

Have you tested your internal lateral movement controls this quarter? 👇

Attackers just turned your trusted PDF reader into a silent spy. 👁️

CVE-2026-3389 · Severity 8.4 · Remote code execution via malformed document metadata.

Our threat intel partners at @Mandiant report that state-sponsored actors are targeting finance teams with this zero-day. We're seeing "clean" files bypass standard sandbox checks.

The exploit triggers as soon as the preview pane renders the file. You don't even have to click "open" for the payload to execute.

*The uncomfortable truth: Your employees' habit of trusting attachments is a liability that no training module can fully fix.*

→ Block all incoming PDF attachments from external senders at the gateway.
→ Push the emergency update to @Adobe Acrobat Enterprise across all endpoints.
→ Disable the preview pane feature in Outlook via Group Policy.

Is your SOC currently hunting for unusual outbound traffic from non-browser apps? 👇

One misconfigured API is all it takes to leak your data. 🚰

$4.2 million · The average cost of a breach caused by shadow cloud infrastructure.

We find that most teams don't actually know how many @AWS S3 buckets are public. Attackers are using automated scanners to find these gaps in minutes.

Our team recently discovered that legacy scripts often leave permissions wide open. We're seeing sensitive customer PII exposed through these forgotten "test" environments.

*The uncomfortable truth: Your cloud "agility" is often just a polite word for bypassing security oversight.*

→ Run an automated scan for public cloud storage buckets today.
→ Audit all API keys that haven't been rotated in 90 days.
→ Enable "Block Public Access" at the account level for @Microsoft Azure and AWS.

Do you have a real-time inventory of every public-facing API in your company? 👇

Ransomware groups are now timing attacks for your board meetings. 📉

72 hours · The window attackers give you before they email your shareholders directly.

According to @RecordedFuture, extortion tactics are becoming hyper-personalized. Attackers are reading your internal calendars to find the most stressful time to strike.

They aren't just locking files anymore; they are weaponizing your own internal communications. We're seeing pressure campaigns targeting individual executives' reputations.

*The uncomfortable truth: A backup strategy is useless if the attackers are holding your reputation hostage instead of your data.*

→ Audit access permissions for executive calendars and email accounts.
→ Send a briefing to the board on non-technical extortion risks.
→ Do a tabletop exercise specifically covering "triple extortion" scenarios.

Is your incident response plan updated to handle direct shareholder extortion? 👇
