      <p>A critical authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2025-49752) has been disclosed in Microsoft Azure Bastion. The flaw allows remote attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and escalate privileges to administrative levels, potentially granting full control over connected virtual machines.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a severe cloud infrastructure risk. Azure Bastion is a hardened gateway for secure RDP/SSH access. Compromising it effectively gives attackers the "keys to the castle," allowing them to pivot laterally across the cloud environment, deploy ransomware, or exfiltrate sensitive data from backend servers.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Azure Bastion validates session tokens, allowing an attacker to replay or forge credentials to bypass security checks. Microsoft has released emergency guidance and patches.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Treat this as an immediate emergency. Direct cloud security teams to verify that Microsoft's automatic updates have applied to your Azure Bastion instances. Rotate all SSH keys and administrative credentials for VMs accessed via Bastion as a precaution.</p>

    <title>Major US Banks Exposed in SitusAMC Vendor Breach</title>

      <p>Client data from major US financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Morgan Stanley, may have been exposed following a cyberattack on technology vendor SitusAMC. The compromised data includes corporate documents, accounting records, and legal contracts.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This supply chain breach highlights the concentrated risk in the financial services vendor ecosystem. While banking operations remain unaffected, the exposure of sensitive client contracts and financial records creates significant legal and reputational risks for the affected banks.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      SitusAMC, a key provider of technology and services to the mortgage and finance industry, was targeted by cybercriminals. The attack did not involve encryption but focused on data exfiltration, a common tactic for extortion.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review your Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) posture for all critical vendors. Ensure legal and compliance teams are prepared for potential regulatory notifications. Verify that vendors holding sensitive financial data adhere to strict security standards.</p>

    <title>Iberia Airlines Confirms Customer Data Breach via Third-Party Vendor</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/23/iberia-airlines-data-breach-vendor-hack</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/airlinehack/800/400" alt="An airplane taking off with a digital glitch effect over the fuselage, symbolizing a cyber incident." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Spanish flag carrier Iberia has notified customers of a data breach stemming from a compromise at a third-party supplier. The breach exposed customer names, email addresses, and frequent flyer numbers. This incident follows similar breaches at other airlines linked to a Salesforce-hosted database.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      While sensitive financial data was reportedly not stolen, the exposure of customer contact details and frequent flyer numbers opens the door for highly targeted phishing campaigns. Attackers can use this data to craft convincing lures to steal airline miles or further compromise user accounts.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The breach originated from a vulnerability in a third-party vendor's system, likely a customer support platform. This pattern of "island hopping" from vendors to major targets continues to be a primary attack vector for large enterprises.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Warn customers and employees to be vigilant against phishing emails purporting to be from the airline. Re-assess the security controls of all vendors with access to customer loyalty and CRM databases.</p>

    <title>Chinese Spy Campaign Hijacks Home Routers for Covert Operations</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/23/china-spy-campaign-hijacks-home-routers</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/routerhack/800/400" alt="A home wifi router with a red eye lens glowing in the center, representing surveillance." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Researchers have uncovered a sophisticated campaign where a Chinese state-backed group is hijacking thousands of home and small office routers (SOHO). They are using proxy malware to turn these devices into a massive, covert network for espionage and attacks against government and telecom targets.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This botnet allows state actors to obfuscate their origin, making attacks appear to come from legitimate residential IP addresses. This complicates attribution and defense, as blocking these IPs could disrupt legitimate users. It poses a direct threat to telecommunications and critical infrastructure security.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The campaign exploits known vulnerabilities in older or unpatched router firmware. Attackers compromise these "soft targets" to build a resilient infrastructure that is difficult for defenders to take down.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      While primarily a consumer issue, organizations should ensure remote employees are using secure, corporate-managed VPNs and not relying solely on personal router security. Update corporate firewall rules to scrutinize traffic from residential ISP ranges accessing critical internal resources.</p>
