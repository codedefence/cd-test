      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Just 24 hours after the Digital Census went live, the primary data collection portal has faced a massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack dubbed "Operation NullCount." Traffic volume peaked at 4.2 Tbps, reportedly originating from a botnet of compromised IoT cameras and legacy routers in the APAC region.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Service degradation for millions of citizens. While no data was breached, the outage has fueled disinformation campaigns questioning the integrity of the census process. For government contractors, this underscores the fragility of public-facing infrastructure during high-visibility events.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Hacktivist groups, likely state-aligned, timed the attack for maximum psychological impact, exploiting the known launch window to undermine public trust in government digital transformation.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> If you manage critical public infrastructure, ensure "DDoS Mitigation" is set to "Always On" rather than "On Demand" during launch windows. Verify that your CDN (Content Delivery Network) has sufficient burst capacity.</p>

    <title>"MobileLock" Ransomware Weaponizes Ivanti EPMM Zero-Day</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/mobile-ransomware/800/400" alt="A smartphone screen displaying a red padlock and a ransom note, symbolizing mobile ransomware." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Following yesterday's CISA alert, a new ransomware strain called "MobileLock" has been observed actively exploiting the Ivanti EPMM vulnerability (CVE-2026-1281). The malware pushes a malicious configuration profile to managed devices that changes the passcode, locks the screen, and displays a ransom demand, effectively holding entire corporate mobile fleets hostage.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Critical operational paralysis. Organizations relying on mobile devices for logistics, field service, or sales are seeing their workforce completely grounded. Recovery is difficult without wiping the devices, which leads to significant data loss.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The speed from "Disclosure" to "Weaponization" was less than 48 hours. Attackers automated the exploit to target unpatched management consoles exposed to the internet.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> <strong>Emergency Measure:</strong> If you haven't patched Ivanti EPMM, take the appliance offline immediately. Prepare "Remote Wipe" protocols for compromised devices and warn employees not to pay individual ransoms.</p>

    <title>$25M "Deepfake CFO" Heist Hits Hong Kong Multinational</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/deepfake-meeting/800/400" alt="A video conference grid where one participant is a digital glitch, representing a deepfake impostor." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Police in Hong Kong are investigating a sophisticated fraud where a finance employee was tricked into transferring $25 million during a video conference call. Every other participant on the call—including the company’s CFO—was a deepfake recreation generated in real-time using public audio/video footage.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This redefines "Business Email Compromise" (BEC) as "Business Identity Compromise." It proves that "seeing is believing" is no longer a valid security control. Financial approval workflows that rely solely on video confirmation are now fundamentally broken.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The attackers used advanced generative AI to clone the voices and faces of multiple executives simultaneously, creating a "social proof" loop that convinced the victim the request was legitimate.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Implement "Out-of-Band" verification for all transactions over $50k. Require a secondary confirmation via an encrypted messaging app (Signal/Teams) or a physical hardware token approval, regardless of who appears to be on the video call.</p>

    <title>New "PolyMal" Framework Uses On-Device AI to Rewrite Malware Code</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/01/polymal-ai-rewrites-malware-evasion</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:45:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/01/polymal-ai-rewrites-malware-evasion</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/polymorphic-code/800/400" alt="Binary code shifting and changing colors like a chameleon, representing polymorphic malware." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Researchers have identified a new malware framework dubbed "PolyMal" that utilizes small, on-device Language Models (SLMs) to rewrite its own source code before every execution. This allows the malware to change its file hash and logic structure dynamically, bypassing traditional signature-based EDR detection.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Evasion Risk. This renders static antivirus signatures obsolete. The malware can "evolve" on the victim's laptop, adapting its behavior to avoid the specific security tools installed on that machine.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The proliferation of open-source, efficient SLMs (like Llama-Nano) allows attackers to bundle powerful code-generation capabilities directly into the malware payload without needing a command-and-control server.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Shift endpoint defense strategy to "Behavioral Analysis" only. Ensure your EDR is tuned to detect "process injection" and "anomalous API calls" rather than relying on file reputation or static scanning.</p>
