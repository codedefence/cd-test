      <p>A massive data breach at Knownsec, a prominent Chinese cybersecurity firm with government ties, has exposed over 12,000 classified documents. The leak includes technical specifications for state-sponsored cyber weapons, source code for proprietary hacking tools, and extensive global target lists.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a historic intelligence windfall for Western defenders but also poses near-term risks. As these sophisticated tools become public, lower-tier cybercriminals may rapidly weaponize them against commercial targets before defenses can be updated.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      While the exact vector is unconfirmed, the scale suggests a major insider leak or a highly sophisticated counter-espionage operation targeting a key pillar of China's offensive cyber ecosystem.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your threat intelligence teams to actively monitor for new Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) derived from this leak. Expect a short-term spike in novel attacks as these exposed tools are analyzed and repurposed by broader criminal groups.</p>

    <title>Critical Container Escape Flaws in 'runc' Threaten Docker &amp; Kubernetes</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/10/runc-container-escape-vulnerabilities</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/containerescape/800/400" alt="A shipping container breaking open with digital code spilling out, symbolizing a container escape vulnerability." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Three severe vulnerabilities (including CVE-2025-31133) have been disclosed in `runc`, the low-level container runtime underpinning Docker and Kubernetes. These flaws allow attackers to break container isolation and achieve root access on the host system by manipulating mount operations.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a catastrophic risk for any organization using containerized infrastructure. A successful exploit allows an attacker to escape a single compromised container and take over the entire underlying node, potentially compromising hundreds of other applications running on the same cluster.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerabilities exploit race conditions and insufficient validation during container creation, specifically how `runc` handles file mounts and symbolic links, allowing attackers to trick the runtime into mounting sensitive host paths.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Mandate an emergency patch cycle for all container hosts. Update to `runc` version 1.2.8 or later immediately. If immediate patching is impossible, ensure strict admission control policies (like preventing privileged containers) are enforced to reduce the attack surface.</p>

    <title>Report: GenAI is Now the Top Channel for Corporate Data Exfiltration</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/10/genai-top-data-exfiltration-channel-report</link>

      <p>A new 2025 Browser Security Report reveals that Generative AI has overtaken all other channels for data exfiltration. 77% of employees admit to pasting corporate data into GenAI prompts, with 82% of this activity occurring via personal, unmanaged accounts that bypass traditional DLP controls.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Organizations are experiencing massive, invisible data leakage. Sensitive IP, PII, and financial data are being fed into public AI models, potentially exposing them to competitors or becoming part of the model's future training data, creating irreversible confidentiality breaches.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Traditional Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools often fail to monitor browser-based paste actions into specific AI websites, especially when employees use personal devices or accounts. The productivity benefits of AI are outpacing security governance.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Deploy browser-level security controls that can specifically monitor and block pasting of sensitive data types (PII, code, financial terms) into unauthorized GenAI applications. Officially sanction secure, enterprise-grade AI alternatives to reduce reliance on shadow IT.</p>

    <title>Critical RCE in 'expr-eval' NPM Library Threatens AI &amp; NLP Applications</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/10/expr-eval-npm-library-critical-rce</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/npmvulnerability/800/400" alt="A complex mathematical formula on a screen glitching into malicious code." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-12735) has been discovered in `expr-eval`, a widely used JavaScript library for mathematical expression evaluation. This library is heavily used in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications to process user input.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Any application using this library to process untrusted user input is vulnerable to complete server takeover. Because it's a deep dependency in many AI/ML pipelines, organizations may be unaware they are even using it, posing a significant stealthy risk.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The library's `evaluate()` method contains a design flaw that allows attackers to define arbitrary functions within the parser's context. By crafting malicious mathematical input, they can escape the sandbox and execute system-level commands.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your application security and development teams to immediately scan all codebases (especially those involving AI/NLP) for the `expr-eval` dependency. Upgrade to the latest patched version or migrate to a secure fork immediately.</p>
