    <title>Malicious VS Code Extension "Prettier" Infects Thousands of Developers</title>

      <p>A massive supply chain attack has targeted the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Attackers uploaded a fake version of the popular "Prettier" code formatter, which was downloaded by thousands of developers. The extension delivers the "Anivia Stealer" malware to exfiltrate login credentials, API keys, and crypto wallets.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a direct hit on the software supply chain. Compromised developer workstations allow attackers to steal cloud credentials (AWS/Azure keys), inject malicious code into corporate products, and bypass perimeter defenses. The impact can extend to customers if the malware reaches production builds.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers used "typosquatting" and manipulated search rankings to trick developers into installing the fake extension instead of the legitimate one. The VS Code Marketplace lacks the strict vetting processes found in mobile app stores.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your DevOps/Engineering leads to audit all installed VS Code extensions immediately. Block the installation of unapproved extensions and consider using a private extension marketplace or strict allow-lists for development environments.</p>

    <title>Akira Ransomware Weaponizes SonicWall VPNs to Target M&amp;A Deals</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/akiramna/800/400" alt="A corporate handshake puzzle piece being broken by a glowing red ransomware lock." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The Akira ransomware group is actively exploiting vulnerabilities in SonicWall SSL VPN devices to target companies involved in Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A). They are stealing sensitive financial data to extort victims, threatening to leak deal details to derail negotiations.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      M&amp;A transactions are highly sensitive and time-critical. A data leak during this process can devalue the deal, trigger regulatory investigations, or cause the transaction to collapse entirely. Akira is leveraging this pressure to demand higher ransom payments.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Akira exploits known, often unpatched vulnerabilities in legacy VPN appliances to gain initial access. They target M&amp;A firms specifically because IT integration periods during mergers often result in temporary security gaps and reduced visibility.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      If your organization is undergoing M&amp;A, prioritize a security audit of the target company's perimeter, specifically VPNs. Mandate MFA on all external access points immediately and monitor for large data exfiltration events during the due diligence phase.</p>

    <title>Google's New "Antigravity" AI Tool Hacked 24 Hours After Launch</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/26/google-antigravity-ai-tool-hacked</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/googleaihack/800/400" alt="A futuristic AI interface with a cracked screen and a 'Backdoor Installed' warning message." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Just one day after its release, security researchers discovered a severe flaw in Google's new "Antigravity" AI coding assistant. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject a persistent backdoor into the user's system, enabling the installation of malware or data theft.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This highlights the immaturity of security controls in rapidly released AI tools. Organizations rushing to adopt the latest AI assistants risk introducing critical vulnerabilities into their environment. A compromised AI coding tool can silently inject backdoors into every piece of software a developer writes.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The tool failed to properly sandbox the code execution environment, allowing the AI model to execute arbitrary system commands on the host machine when processing malicious prompts or code snippets.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Restrict the use of "Antigravity" and similar bleeding-edge AI coding tools until they have passed a rigorous internal security review. Ensure developers run AI tools in isolated environments (containers/VMs) that cannot access production networks.</p>

    <title>FBI Alert: Cybercriminals Spoofing IC3.gov to Phish Victims</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/26/fbi-warns-fake-ic3-website-phishing</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/fbiic3fake/800/400" alt="A laptop screen showing a fake FBI website with a 'Submit Personal Info' form, representing a phishing scam." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The FBI has issued an urgent warning about fake websites spoofing the official Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov). Scammers are using SEO poisoning and look-alike domains (e.g., ichelpindex.com) to trick victims of cybercrime into submitting sensitive personal data and banking details under the guise of filing a report.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This preys on employees or individuals who have already been victimized, leading to "revictimization." It complicates incident response, as employees attempting to report a breach may inadvertently hand over more data to criminals, worsening the situation.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers are exploiting the trust in government institutions. They use sponsored search ads to ensure their fake sites appear at the top of search results when victims look for "how to report cybercrime."</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Update your incident response plan to include the correct, verified URLs for reporting cybercrime (www.ic3.gov). Educate employees that the FBI will never ask for sensitive banking passwords or fees to investigate a crime via a web form.</p>
