    <title>Bahrain Central Bank Issues Emergency Circular: "Voice Biometrics" Suspended</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Following yesterday's global alert on AI voice cloning, the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has issued an emergency circular to all retail banks. Effective immediately, "Voice Authentication" is suspended as a standalone verification factor for transactions over BD 500. Banks must revert to OTP or hardware-token verification until voice-engine countermeasures are deployed.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High operational friction for phone banking centers. Expect increased call handle times and customer complaints. However, this dramatically reduces the immediate risk of "Deepfake CEO Fraud" hitting local corporate accounts.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The CBB acted proactively after intelligence reports confirmed that regional "Voice-as-a-Service" tools could bypass standard banking IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems with 90% success rates.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Update your internal "Wire Transfer Policy" today. Mandate a "dual-channel" verification (e.g., a follow-up WhatsApp or email confirmation) for any payment instruction received via phone, regardless of how "authentic" the requestor sounds.</p>

    <title>HuggingFace Purges 4,000 "Sleeper Agent" AI Models</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> HuggingFace, the hub of open-source AI, has removed over 4,000 models identified as "Sleeper Agents." These models functioned normally for standard queries but were programmed to inject malicious code or exfiltrate data when triggered by specific keywords (e.g., "AWS_KEY" or "production_db").</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This is a massive "Supply Chain" wake-up call. If your data science team pulled any of these models for internal fine-tuning, your environment may already be compromised. This highlights the risk of using "unverified" open-source weights in production.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Attackers realized that poisoning the *model* is more effective than poisoning the *code*, as traditional antivirus tools cannot scan inside a 10GB neural network file.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Block direct downloads from HuggingFace to production servers. Establish a private "Model Registry" where weights are scanned (using new tools like 'ModelScan') and sandboxed before being approved for developer use.</p>

    <title>EV Charging Network "PowerLock" Ransomware Hits Europe</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/07/ev-charging-ransomware-powerlock</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 18:00:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/07/ev-charging-ransomware-powerlock</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/ev-ransomware/800/400" alt="An electric vehicle charging station screen displaying a red 'Ransom Demand' message." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A new ransomware strain dubbed "PowerLock" has infected 12,000 public EV chargers across Germany and France. The malware doesn't steal data but physically locks the charging cables into the vehicles, holding the cars hostage until a ransom is paid via QR code.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This moves cyber threats into the physical domain ("Cyber-Kinetic"). For logistics fleets relying on electric vans, this could cause massive delivery disruptions. It also raises liability questions for CPOs (Charge Point Operators).</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The chargers were running outdated embedded Linux kernels and shared a common default root password for maintenance access, which attackers brute-forced en masse.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> If your company operates an EV fleet, ensure drivers have the manual emergency release protocols for your specific vehicle models. Review the security clauses in your SLA with charging infrastructure providers.</p>

    <title>Okta "Session Hook" Vulnerability (CVE-2026-1002) Disclosed</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/07/okta-session-hook-vulnerability</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/07/okta-session-hook-vulnerability</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/okta-hack-2026/800/400" alt="An Okta login screen with a digital hook pulling a session token out of the browser." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Researchers have disclosed a flaw in Okta's "Inline Hook" feature (CVE-2026-1002). Attackers with low-level API access can manipulate the session token *during* the authentication flow, extending the session lifetime indefinitely or escalating privileges without triggering MFA logs.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Identity is the new perimeter, and this flaw breaks the lock. It allows "Shadow Access" where a terminated employee or intruder can maintain access to SaaS apps (Salesforce, Slack) long after their account should have been revoked.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> A logic error in how the hook validates the "JSON Web Token" (JWT) signature allowed for parameter tampering.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Rotate all Okta API tokens immediately. Review your "Inline Hook" configurations and disable any hooks that are not strictly necessary until the patch (released today) is verified.</p>
