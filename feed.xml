      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Google has urgently released Chrome version 145 to patch CVE-2026-2441, a high-severity "use-after-free" vulnerability in the CSS engine. This is the first confirmed actively exploited Chrome zero-day of the year. The flaw allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the browser sandbox by convincing a user to visit a specially crafted malicious webpage.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Extreme Endpoint Risk. Chrome is the primary gateway for enterprise SaaS and web activity. Successful exploitation grants attackers a foothold on employee workstations, enabling session hijacking, credential theft, and lateral movement into cloud environments.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> A memory management error in the CSS rendering component allowed malicious HTML/CSS code to reference memory after it had been freed, leading to code execution.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> <strong>Force Update.</strong> Mandate an immediate restart of all Chrome, Edge, and Brave browsers across the organization to ensure version 145 (or equivalent) is active. For managed fleets, use Intune or Jamf to verify the update status within 24 hours.</p>

    <title>Critical BeyondTrust Exploit (CVE-2026-1731) Escalates to Full Domain Control</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Threat actors have rapidly weaponized the unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw in BeyondTrust Remote Support and Privileged Remote Access (CVE-2026-1731). Arctic Wolf reports that attackers are now using the flaw to deploy SimpleHelp RMM tools for persistence and gaining full domain administrative control within hours of initial access.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> "Keys to the Kingdom" Event. BeyondTrust is the gatekeeper for privileged accounts. A breach here allows an attacker to impersonate any admin, bypass MFA, and export sensitive company data or deploy ransomware with total authority.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> A proof-of-concept (PoC) was released just 24 hours ago, and scanning operations associated with commercial VPNs in Frankfurt have already localized 86% of the reconnaissance traffic.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> <strong>Emergency Mitigation:</strong> If you use self-hosted BeyondTrust PRA/RS, you must patch to the latest version immediately. Check logs for the installation of unauthorized RMM tools like SimpleHelp and rotate all high-privilege credentials managed by the appliance.</p>

    <title>New "ClickFix" Malware Wave Exploits Windows Social Engineering</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/16/clickfix-malware-campaign-windows-social-engineering</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 18:00:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/16/clickfix-malware-campaign-windows-social-engineering</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/clickfix/800/400" alt="A deceptive Windows update dialog with a green 'Fix' button that reveals a hidden spider silhouette." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A new social engineering campaign dubbed "ClickFix" is targeting Windows users by displaying deceptive error messages on compromised websites. The pop-ups instruct users to copy and run a "fix" command in their PowerShell terminal. In reality, the command downloads and executes the XWorm RAT, granting attackers full remote control of the device.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Risk of Individual Compromise. This attack bypasses browser-level security because the user is tricked into manually executing the malicious script. For corporate environments, this highlights a failure of "Human Firewall" awareness regarding advanced social engineering.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Attackers are exploiting "verification fatigue." By mimicking legitimate tech support or browser update prompts, they convince users to perform the "dangerous action" (running code) themselves.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Update internal security training to specifically warn against "copy-paste terminal commands" from websites. Implement Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) policies that alert on or block PowerShell executions from unverified sources.</p>

    <title>Critical FileZen Flaw Allows Arbitrary Command Execution via Japanese File Transfer Hub</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/16/filezen-arbitrary-command-execution-vulnerability</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/filezen-hack/800/400" alt="A digital file folder with a red exclamation mark and a binary code injection pulse." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A critical vulnerability in FileZen, a widely used file transfer solution from Japan’s Soliton Systems, allows authenticated attackers to run arbitrary operating system commands. This flaw is being targeted in specific regional espionage campaigns aiming to exfiltrate corporate intellectual property.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Supply Chain Risk for APAC-linked firms. FileZen is often used to share sensitive data with Japanese partners. A compromise allows attackers to use the transfer hub as a pivot point to infect all files being exchanged with external clients.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Inadequate input sanitization within the application's file processing logic allowed for OS command injection via specially crafted file names or metadata.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> If FileZen is in your environment, apply the security update from Soliton immediately. Audit all recent file transfer logs for anomalous activity and ensure that any shared file storage is isolated from core production systems.</p>
