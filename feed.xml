    <title>Massive Credential Leak: 149 Million Passwords Exposed via Unsecured Database</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Researcher Jeremiah Fowler has uncovered a 96GB unsecured database containing 149 million unique logins and passwords. This is not a single-company breach but a massive collection of "infostealer logs"—data stolen from individual devices by malware and subsequently compiled. The data spans Gmail (48M records), Facebook, Netflix, and even sensitive government email addresses.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High risk of Credential Stuffing. Attackers are using this pre-categorized list to automate takeovers of corporate enterprise systems. For your clients in Bahrain, this likely includes personal accounts used for "Shadow IT," providing an easy entry point into corporate environments.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The rise of "Infostealer-as-a-Service" allows low-skill actors to harvest credentials at scale. This specific database was left publicly accessible without a password, allowing anyone with the IP to download nearly 150 million sets of credentials.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Mandate a company-wide password reset for any personal accounts linked to corporate recovery emails. Enforce hardware-based MFA (FIDO2) to render stolen passwords useless.</p>

    <title>Gmail Spam Filter Collapse: Global Inbox Outage Triggers Phishing Surge</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/25/gmail-spam-filter-crash-outage</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/gmail-outage/800/400" alt="A Gmail logo overflowing with malicious envelopes and spam warnings." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Google's automated sorting and spam filters for Gmail have effectively crashed globally today. Users are reporting that the "Promotions" and "Social" tabs are empty while their primary inboxes are flooded with years-old newsletters, junk, and—most dangerously—highly convincing phishing emails that usually would be blocked.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High threat to employee productivity and security. With filters down, the volume of "noise" makes it easier for a targeted spear-phishing attack to go unnoticed. Additionally, some users report delays in receiving 2FA codes, causing operational friction.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Google Workspace Status Dashboard confirms an engineering issue with the sorting algorithm. While a full postmortem is pending, the failure highlights the total reliance of modern email security on cloud-based AI filtering.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Issue an "Urgent Advisory" to all staff: "Gmail filters are currently inactive. Treat every email in your primary inbox as untrusted until further notice." Consider enabling stricter attachment sandboxing at the gateway level.</p>

    <title>CISA KEV Alert: Hackers Exploit Versa, Zimbra, and Vite Frameworks</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/25/cisa-kev-alert-versa-zimbra-vite-exploits</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/cisa-kev-alert/800/400" alt="CISA logo next to a list of vulnerable software frameworks being scanned by a red laser." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CISA has added four new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog this weekend. Key targets include Versa Director (critical for SD-WAN management) and the Zimbra Collaboration suite. These flaws are being actively used by state-sponsored actors to gain initial access to government and infrastructure networks.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High. SD-WAN (Versa) and Email (Zimbra) are critical backbone services. If compromised, attackers can intercept all corporate traffic or read every executive communication. This is a direct threat to the integrity of regional infrastructure.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> These are "classic" vulnerabilities—Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Authentication Bypass—that have been weaponized because the patching cycles for management-level infrastructure continue to lag behind active exploitation.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Patch Versa and Zimbra instances immediately (by the Feb 12 due date). Use this as a trigger to audit your "SD-WAN" security posture, as these management layers are becoming a favorite target for APT groups.</p>

    <title>Davos 2026: Salesforce CEO Warns Unregulated AI is "Social Media 2.0"</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/25/salesforce-ceo-davos-ai-regulation-warning</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/davos-ai/800/400" alt="Marc Benioff speaking at Davos with a background of AI nodes and red warning signs." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff urged immediate, strict regulation of AI. He compared the current state of AI to the early, unregulated days of social media, warning that hallucinations and technical instabilities pose a massive risk to children and the global economy if guardrails aren't established now.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This signals a shift in corporate sentiment: even AI leaders are asking for regulation. For your consultancy, this translates to a massive upcoming demand for "AI Governance" and "Ethical AI Audits" as governments begin to translate these warnings into law.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The rapid, bottom-up adoption of Generative AI has outpaced safety testing. High-profile hallucinations in enterprise environments have spooked leaders who fear legal liability and brand damage.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Don't wait for regulation. Establish an internal "AI Ethics & Safety Board" today. Review your ISO 42001 (AI Management) readiness to ensure you are ahead of the mandatory compliance curve.</p>
