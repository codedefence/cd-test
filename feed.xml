      <p>Three major London councils—Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, and Hammersmith and Fulham—have confirmed they are victims of a coordinated cyberattack. The incident has taken critical IT systems and phone lines offline, disrupting public services for thousands of residents.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This attack highlights the vulnerability of local government infrastructure. The disruption of essential services (social care, housing, payments) erodes public trust and creates immediate operational chaos. Recovery is expected to take weeks, with significant costs for remediation and potential data loss.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      While the specific vector is under investigation, coordinated attacks on shared services often exploit vulnerabilities in managed service providers (MSPs) or shared software platforms used by multiple local authorities.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Public sector leaders must review their business continuity plans for a "total loss of IT" scenario. Ensure that shared service agreements include strict cybersecurity SLAs and that offline backups are available to restore critical citizen services quickly.</p>

    <title>Microsoft to Block External Scripts in Entra ID to Stop Phishing</title>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/entraid/800/400" alt="A secure login screen with a shield blocking a malicious code script from executing." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Microsoft has announced a major security update for Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). The platform will now block the execution of external scripts during the sign-in process. This change aims to neutralize "Adversary-in-the-Middle" (AiTM) phishing kits that inject malicious scripts to steal session tokens.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a significant hardening of the identity perimeter. It will break many sophisticated phishing tools used to bypass MFA. However, it may also impact legitimate custom branding or customizations organizations have applied to their login pages that rely on external scripts.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      AiTM attacks have become the primary method for bypassing MFA. By preventing the browser from loading unauthorized scripts during authentication, Microsoft is closing a major loophole used by phishing-as-a-service platforms like EvilProxy.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your IAM team to review your Entra ID branding configurations immediately. Test authentication flows to ensure no legitimate business processes rely on external scripts that will be blocked by this update. Prepare helpdesk staff for potential user tickets.</p>

    <title>Critical Flaw in ASUS AiCloud Routers (CVE-2025-59366) Exposed</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/28/asus-aicloud-router-critical-vulnerability</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/asusrouter/800/400" alt="A home wifi router with a red warning light and an unlocked padlock icon." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A critical authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2025-59366, CVSS 9.2) has been disclosed in ASUS AiCloud routers. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to bypass security checks and execute privileged functions, effectively taking full control of the device.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      With many employees working from home, compromised SOHO routers are a direct gateway into corporate networks. Attackers can use these devices to intercept traffic, launch man-in-the-middle attacks, or pivot into the enterprise VPN connected to the device.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability lies in the AiCloud remote access feature, which fails to properly validate user sessions. This allows attackers to send malicious requests that the router processes as if they came from an administrator.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Issue an advisory to remote employees using ASUS routers to update their firmware immediately. Recommend disabling the "AiCloud" and "Remote Access" features on personal routers unless strictly necessary, as these are frequent targets for exploitation.</p>

    <title>"Shai Hulud 2.0" Supply Chain Worm Compromises 1,200+ Organizations</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/28/shai-hulud-2-0-worm-supply-chain</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/wormattack/800/400" alt="A digital worm tunneling through a network of server icons, turning them red." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The "Shai Hulud" supply chain attack has escalated. A new variant, version 2.0, has been detected spreading automatically through CI/CD pipelines, compromising over 1,200 organizations including major banks and Fortune 500 companies. The worm exposes critical runtime secrets and API keys.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a self-propagating supply chain disaster. The worm leverages compromised credentials from one victim to commit malicious code to the repositories of their partners and vendors, creating a cascading effect. Stolen secrets allow immediate access to cloud infrastructure and customer data.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The worm targets unmonitored "non-human" identities (service accounts) in DevOps environments. Once inside a build pipeline, it injects itself into the codebase and pushes the infected update to downstream consumers.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Activate your incident response plan for a major supply chain event. Scan all CI/CD logs for unauthorized commits or unexpected external connections. Rotate all secrets (API keys, cloud tokens) used in your build pipelines immediately as a precaution.</p>

    <title>Comcast Fined $1.5M by FCC for Vendor Data Breach</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/28/comcast-fcc-fine-vendor-breach</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/comcastfine/800/400" alt="A gavel striking a stack of documents stamped 'Data Breach', with a $1.5M fine notice." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Comcast has agreed to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty to settle an FCC investigation into a 2023 data breach. The breach occurred at a third-party vendor, exposing the sensitive data of over 35 million customers. The FCC cited a failure to properly oversee vendor security practices.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This enforcement action sets a precedent: organizations are financially and legally liable for the security failures of their vendors. It underscores that outsourcing operations does not outsource risk. The fine serves as a warning to all regulated industries regarding third-party oversight.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The breach occurred because a vendor failed to implement basic security controls (like MFA) on a legacy system. Comcast was penalized for failing to audit and enforce security requirements outlined in its vendor contracts.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review your Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) contracts. Ensure you have the "right to audit" and are actually exercising it for high-risk vendors. Verify that your vendors are meeting the same security standards you apply internally.</p>
