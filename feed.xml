      <p>Amazon and Wiz threat intelligence teams report that China-nexus threat groups (tracked as "Earth Lamia" and "Jackpot Panda") have rapidly scaled their exploitation of the critical "React2Shell" vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182). Attackers are actively scanning for and compromising unpatched Next.js and React applications to establish persistent footholds.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      The speed of weaponization—within hours of disclosure—demonstrates the high value of this vulnerability to espionage groups. Unpatched web servers are being converted into operational nodes for further attacks, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within cloud environments.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote code execution via the React Flight protocol. State actors are prioritizing it because it bypasses standard authentication layers on widely used, public-facing web infrastructure.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This remains the top priority. Ensure your engineering teams have updated React to version 19.0.1+ and Next.js to the latest safe versions. If patching is delayed, deploy specific WAF rules to block malicious "React Flight" payloads immediately.</p>

    <title>Coupang Data Breach Exposes 33.7 Million Customers</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/coupang-breach/800/400" alt="A digital map of South Korea with data streams leaking out, representing a massive e-commerce breach." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang has issued a revised notice confirming a massive data leak affecting 33.7 million customers—nearly two-thirds of the country's population. While payment data was reportedly not stolen, exposed information includes names, addresses, and contact details.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a catastrophic privacy incident for a market leader. The massive volume of exposed PII creates a long-term risk of targeted phishing and fraud for millions of users. It will likely trigger intense regulatory scrutiny and significant fines under local data protection laws.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The breach reportedly originated from unauthorized access via overseas servers. Attackers managed to bypass perimeter defenses to access customer databases, highlighting potential gaps in geo-blocking or access monitoring strategies.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      For organizations operating in APAC, review your data residency and cross-border access controls. Ensure that "crown jewel" customer databases have strict anomaly detection alerts for bulk exports, especially to unexpected geographic locations.</p>

    <title>Record-Breaking 29.7 Tbps DDoS Attack Hits Financial Sector</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/07/record-29tbps-ddos-financial-sector</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/ddos-record-2025/800/400" alt="A digital bank vault being overwhelmed by a massive red wave of network traffic." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Cloudflare and Akamai have reported mitigating the largest DDoS attack in history, peaking at 29.7 Terabits per second (Tbps). The attack, launched by the "Aisuru" IoT botnet, specifically targeted European financial institutions using massive UDP floods.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This attack volume redefines the "worst-case scenario" for availability. Traditional on-premise DDoS appliances would be instantly overwhelmed. An attack of this magnitude can take down not just individual banks, but regional internet exchanges if not mitigated at the edge.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The "Aisuru" botnet leverages millions of compromised consumer IoT devices (cameras, routers) connected to high-speed 5G and fiber networks, allowing it to generate unprecedented volumetric traffic.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Verify your organization's DDoS resilience. Ensure critical customer-facing services are protected by a cloud-based scrubbing provider capable of absorbing multi-terabit attacks. Test your "failover" plans for a scenario where primary internet links are saturated.</p>

    <title>New "GoldPickaxe" Malware Variants Target iOS &amp; Android Banking</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/07/goldpickaxe-malware-ios-android-banking</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/goldpickaxe-malware/800/400" alt="A smartphone screen scanning a user's face, with a malicious data theft icon in the background." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The "GoldFactory" group has released new variants of its "GoldPickaxe" malware, targeting banking users in Southeast Asia. This advanced trojan steals facial recognition data to create deepfakes for bypassing biometric security and is now being distributed via fake government service apps on both Android and iOS.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This malware represents a direct threat to biometric identity verification. By stealing raw facial data, attackers can bypass "liveness" checks used by banking apps and corporate MFA systems, enabling high-value fraud and account takeovers.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers are using social engineering (fake pension/government apps) to trick users into installing the malware. On iOS, they abuse the TestFlight platform or MDM profiles to bypass App Store security checks.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Update fraud detection models to look for anomalies in biometric authentication attempts. Educate employees and customers about the risks of installing apps from outside official stores ("sideloading"), especially those claiming to be government tools.</p>
