    <title>Critical Fortinet SSL VPN RCE (CVE-2025-7721) Discovered via Holiday Traffic</title>

      <p>Security researchers have disclosed a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Fortinet FortiGate SSL VPN devices (CVE-2025-7721, CVSS 9.8). Threat actors were observed exploiting this flaw during the holiday traffic surge to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands as root.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a "Level 1" emergency for any organization using Fortinet for remote access. Unlike previous flaws, this exploit requires no credentials and can be automated. A successful breach grants total control over the network perimeter, allowing for immediate ransomware deployment or silent data exfiltration.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability exists in the web portal handling of specific HTTP requests. Attackers masked their exploit traffic inside the increased volume of legitimate remote-work traffic occurring between Christmas and New Year's.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      <strong>Immediate Action Required:</strong> If you cannot apply the emergency patch released today, you must disable the SSL-VPN web portal functionality immediately. Isolate the management interface and review logs for any unauthorized shell commands executed since Dec 24.</p>

    <title>GCC Payment Gateways Hit by "DarkStorm" Botnet DDoS</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/30/gcc-payment-gateway-darkstorm-ddos</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/payment-gateway-ddos/800/400" alt="A digital map of the Middle East with red data nodes targeting financial hubs in Bahrain and UAE." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A coordinated DDoS campaign dubbed "DarkStorm" is currently targeting payment processors and banking portals across Bahrain, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. The attack volume has peaked at 2.5 Tbps, causing intermittent transaction failures for retail POS systems and mobile banking apps during the busy year-end sales period.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      For banking clients, this threatens transaction availability and customer trust. The attackers are using a new "Application Layer" flood that mimics legitimate user behavior, making it difficult for standard firewalls to distinguish between a real customer and a bot.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The botnet is comprised largely of compromised IoT devices (cameras, DVRs) within the region, allowing the traffic to bypass "Geo-Blocking" defenses that typically filter out traffic from outside the GCC.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Activate "Under Attack" mode on your WAF (Web Application Firewall) immediately. Shift traffic monitoring to "Behavioral Analysis" rather than just IP reputation. Communicate proactively with merchants if payment latencies increase.</p>

    <title>PyPI Supply Chain Attack Targets Financial Modeling Libraries</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/30/pypi-malicious-package-financial-modeling</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/python-malware/800/400" alt="A Python logo with a snake biting a credit card, symbolizing a supply chain attack on financial code." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Check Point Research has identified a new wave of malicious packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI) that use "Typosquatting" to mimic popular financial analysis libraries (e.g., `pandas-finance-tool` instead of `pandas-finance`). These packages contain scripts that scan developer environments for AWS keys and banking API credentials.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This directly targets the developers building fintech apps. If a developer accidentally installs the wrong package, their machine—and all the production keys stored on it—are compromised. This can lead to unauthorized access to the core banking ledger or customer databases.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers know that year-end reporting requires heavy data analysis. They published these packages yesterday to catch analysts and developers rushing to generate Q4 financial reports.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Block direct access to public PyPI repositories from production servers. Use a private artifact manager (like Artifactory) to quarantine and scan new packages before they are allowed into the development environment.</p>

    <title>DORA Compliance Panic: EU Banks Scramble as Jan 2026 Deadline Looms</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/30/dora-compliance-deadline-jan-2026</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/compliance-deadline/800/400" alt="A European Union flag with a digital shield and a clock ticking down to 2026." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>As the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) becomes fully enforceable in January 2026, reports indicate that nearly 40% of financial institutions with EU ties are still not fully compliant with the "Third Party Risk Management" (TPRM) requirements. Regulators have signaled that fines will be issued starting in Q1.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      For Bahraini banks with branches or significant transaction flows in Europe, DORA is not optional. Non-compliance can result in fines of up to 1% of average daily worldwide turnover. This is creating a sudden demand for ICT risk audits and "Exit Strategy" documentation for critical cloud vendors.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Many organizations underestimated the complexity of mapping their entire supply chain. DORA requires not just securing your own systems, but proving that your critical vendors (Cloud, SaaS) have sufficient resilience.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Conduct a "DORA Gap Analysis" this week. Focus specifically on your "Register of Information" regarding third-party ICT providers. Ensure you have a documented and tested exit strategy for your primary cloud provider.</p>
