Your SD-WAN fabric is under active attack for root-level control. 🛡️

CVE-2026-20127 · Severity 10.0 · Critical Authentication Bypass in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has issued Emergency Directive 26-03 following confirmed active exploitation of @[Cisco](urn:li:organization:1063) SD-WAN Manager and Controller. This maximum-severity flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass peering authentication and obtain high-privilege administrative access.

Federal agencies have been ordered to apply patches by 5:00 PM ET today. Evidence suggests that a sophisticated actor has been leveraging this flaw for silent network persistence. If your management plane is reachable from the internet, you are at immediate risk of a fabric-wide compromise.

The uncomfortable truth: If your SD-WAN controller is breached, the attacker can manipulate policies, route traffic, and add rogue peers across your entire global network.

→ Patch Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager and Controller instances to the fixed release immediately.
→ Isolate SD-WAN management interfaces from the public internet using strict ACLs.
→ Hunt for unauthorized peers or unexpected root-level logins in your controller logs.

Have you verified the integrity of your SD-WAN peering authentication today? 👇

Your security console just became a gateway for a full system takeover. 🛑

CVE-2025-71210 · Severity 9.8 · Critical Path Traversal and RCE in Trend Micro Apex One.

We are seeing a critical alert for @[Trend Micro](urn:li:organization:1843) Apex One users. A path traversal flaw in the management console allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. While the SaaS version has been updated, on-premise installations remain vulnerable until manually patched.

Attackers can leverage this to disable endpoint protections and deploy ransomware across the entire managed environment. This vulnerability demonstrates that the tools meant to protect your fleet can be turned into a weapon against it.

The uncomfortable truth: A single unpatched security management server can lead to a 100% compromise rate across your workstations.

→ Update on-premise Apex One to Critical Patch Build 14136 or higher immediately.
→ Restrict console access to administrative segments only.
→ Monitor for unauthorized file modifications within the Apex One installation directories.

Is your on-premise security infrastructure included in your emergency patch cycle? 👇

Attackers are weaponizing the core of the internet to bypass your filters. 🕸️

New Phishing Anomaly · Reverse DNS abuse in the .arpa top-level domain.

We are seeing a novel phishing method that bypasses traditional domain reputation checks by hosting malicious content on reverse DNS records within the .arpa space. Attackers are creating IPv6 tunnels and abusing @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) and other DNS provider controls to host fraudulent sites.

Because .arpa is a reserved infrastructure domain, most security products don't even look at it as a potential threat surface. This allows phishing emails to deliver links that look like legitimate internet plumbing while siphoning executive credentials.

The uncomfortable truth: If your security stack only looks for malicious .com or .net URLs, you are blind to attacks coming from the internet's own foundation.

→ Block all outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the .arpa top-level domain at the gateway.
→ Inspect DNS logs for unusual reverse lookup patterns involving high-volume IPv6 tunnels.
→ Update your phishing protection rules to include infrastructure-based TLDs.

Does your current web filter even recognize .arpa as a resolvable web destination? 👇

One click is still enough to bypass your entire Windows security stack. 🔓

CVE-2026-21510 · Severity 8.8 · Active exploitation of Windows Shell and SmartScreen.

We are seeing a continued wave of exploitation targeting this @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) zero-day. Attackers use crafted shortcut files to bypass the SmartScreen security warnings that normally alert users to untrusted content. This allows for silent code execution upon a single user click.

Ransomware groups have already integrated this bypass into their phishing kits to reduce the "friction" of an infection. When the OS fails to provide a warning, the last line of defense is removed.

The uncomfortable truth: If you are relying on user intuition to spot malicious files, you have already lost the battle against sophisticated UI bypasses.

→ Apply the February 2026 Microsoft security updates to all Windows endpoints today.
→ Enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent obfuscated scripts from launching.
→ Audit for unauthorized .LNK files in user profile temporary directories.

Have you confirmed that your endpoint security policy is actively blocking untrusted script execution? 👇
