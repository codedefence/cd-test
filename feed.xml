      <p>CISA has issued a critical advisory regarding the Iskra iHUB and iHUB Lite smart metering gateways. A severe vulnerability (CVE-2025-13510, CVSS 9.3) allows unauthenticated remote attackers to access the web management interface, reconfigure devices, and manipulate connected energy systems without credentials.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This vulnerability poses a direct threat to the energy sector and critical infrastructure. Compromised gateways could allow attackers to disrupt power distribution, manipulate metering data, or use the devices as a pivot point to attack broader OT networks, leading to potential blackouts or safety incidents.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The device exposes its critical management interface to the network without requiring any authentication by default, a fundamental security oversight in hardware designed for critical infrastructure.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct OT security teams to isolate Iskra iHUB devices immediately. Ensure they are not accessible from the public internet or corporate IT networks. Apply the latest firmware updates and place these devices behind strict firewalls or VPNs.</p>

    <title>Salesforce-Gainsight Supply Chain Breach Impacts 200+ Organizations</title>

      <p>Google has confirmed a major supply chain breach affecting over 200 companies. Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the integration between Salesforce and Gainsight (a customer success platform) to steal sensitive customer data. The attack has been attributed to a coalition of threat actors dubbed "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters."</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This incident demonstrates the high risk of SaaS-to-SaaS connectivity. Organizations relying on this integration may have had their entire Salesforce customer database exposed, including financial details and sales pipelines, bypassing their own direct security controls.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers compromised the API connection tokens used by Gainsight to talk to Salesforce. This allowed them to impersonate the integration and exfiltrate data without triggering standard intrusion alarms on the Salesforce tenant itself.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review all third-party apps connected to your Salesforce environment. Revoke access tokens for Gainsight apps immediately if you are a customer, until re-authentication is confirmed safe. Audit SaaS integration permissions to ensure "least privilege."</p>

    <title>CISA &amp; International Partners Release "Secure AI in OT" Guidance</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/03/cisa-secure-ai-in-ot-guidance</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/aiotguidance/800/400" alt="A factory floor with robotic arms being managed by an AI brain, overlaid with a security shield." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>CISA, in collaboration with Australian and international cyber agencies, has released new guidance on "Principles for the Secure Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Operational Technology." The document outlines how critical infrastructure owners should safely deploy AI/ML in industrial environments.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      As industrial sectors rush to adopt AI for efficiency, this guidance creates a new de facto standard for liability and due diligence. Failing to adhere to these principles could lead to regulatory negligence claims if an AI-driven failure causes physical damage or safety incidents.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The convergence of AI and OT introduces novel risks, such as unpredictable machine behavior and expanded attack surfaces, which traditional industrial safety protocols (like SIS) were not designed to handle.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your Chief Operations Officer (COO) and CISO to jointly review this guidance. Establish a governance framework that requires a safety impact assessment before any AI model is deployed into a production OT environment.</p>

    <title>Mass Exploitation of "King Addons" WordPress Vulnerability (CVE-2025-8489)</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/03/king-addons-wordpress-mass-exploit</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/wordpresspluginhack/800/400" alt="The WordPress logo surrounded by shield icons that are cracking under a cyber attack." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Threat actors are actively launching mass exploitation attacks against a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-8489, CVSS 9.8) in the "King Addons for Elementor" WordPress plugin. Security firms report over 50,000 exploit attempts aimed at taking over vulnerable websites.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      A successful exploit grants the attacker full administrative control over the website. This allows them to deface the site, inject SEO spam, host malware, or redirect customers to phishing pages, causing severe brand damage and loss of customer trust.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The plugin contained an insecure registration function that allowed unauthenticated users to register as administrators without any verification. Attackers are using automated scripts to scan for and exploit this flaw at scale.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your web team to update the King Addons plugin to version 51.1.35 or later immediately. If patching is not possible, disable the plugin. Scan your website for unauthorized administrator accounts created since mid-October.</p>
