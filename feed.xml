Your mobile device management is now a backdoor for attackers. 📱

CVE-2026-1281 · Severity 9.8 · Critical unauthenticated RCE in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM).

We are seeing attackers use automated scanners to locate vulnerable @[Ivanti](urn:li:organization:36124) servers. Successful exploitation allows for full control of the MDM infrastructure and a direct path into your enterprise network.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has added this to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog today. Attackers are currently deploying web shells and establishing persistent backdoors that survive standard restarts.

The uncomfortable truth: The tool you use to secure your mobile fleet is currently the most effective way for an attacker to bypass your entire perimeter.

→ Patch all EPMM instances to the latest security release immediately.
→ Audit your server logs for unusual HTTP requests targeting legacy bash scripts.
→ Conduct a full forensic review of managed devices for unauthorized app installations.

Have you verified that your MDM management portal is restricted to trusted administrative IPs? 👇

State-sponsored actors have been living in your backups for months. 🛡️

CVE-2026-22769 · Severity 10.0 · Hardcoded credentials in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines.

We are seeing reports that China-linked espionage groups have exploited this flaw since mid-2024. The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has given federal agencies only three days to patch this due to the extreme risk.

Attackers are using "Ghost NICs" on virtual machines to quietly pivot through compromised environments without alerting security teams. This allows for long-term persistence within your disaster recovery site.

The uncomfortable truth: Your disaster recovery plan is a weapon in the hands of an attacker if your backup infrastructure is unpatched.

→ Update @[Dell Technologies](urn:li:organization:1193) RecoverPoint for VMs to the patched version by tomorrow morning.
→ Rotate all administrative credentials associated with your virtualization and backup stack.
→ Hunt for unauthorized lateral movement originating from your disaster recovery nodes.

Is your SOC currently monitoring your backup infrastructure for unauthorized network pivots? 👇

If your team uses Markdown, your endpoints are at risk today. 📝

CVE-2026-20841 · Severity 7.8 · Remote code execution in Windows 11 Notepad via crafted Markdown links.

We are seeing attackers distribute malicious README files that trigger unverified protocol launches. One click on a link in @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) Notepad is enough to execute remote code.

This flaw demonstrates how even the most basic native applications are now being weaponized. If your organization relies on Store-based app updates, your patching may be lagging behind.

The uncomfortable truth: Your security boundary is only as strong as the least complex application your users trust.

→ Force an update of the Notepad Store app to the latest version immediately.
→ Restrict the use of high-risk protocol handlers at the operating system level.
→ Audit your environment for unexpected process chains originating from notepad.exe.

Are you managing Store-based application updates with the same rigor as your OS patches? 👇

Your browser is the primary entry point for modern ransomware. 🌐

CVE-2026-2441 · Severity 8.8 · First actively exploited Chrome zero-day of 2026 targeting CSS components.

We are seeing attackers leverage this flaw to execute arbitrary code within the browser sandbox. While @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) has released a fix, unpatched browsers remain a critical risk to your entire enterprise.

Attackers are currently pairing this with social engineering to target corporate users. A single visit to a compromised website can initiate a full infection chain.

The uncomfortable truth: Your users are one malicious click away from a system compromise if you do not automate your browser updates.

→ Ensure all @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) Chrome instances are updated to version 145.0.7632.75 or later.
→ Enable hardware-enforced stack protection on all compatible Windows endpoints.
→ Monitor for unusual outbound traffic originating from browser processes.

Have you confirmed that your browser update policy is successfully reaching 100% of your fleet? 👇
