      <p>Microsoft has released its November 2025 Patch Tuesday, addressing 63 new vulnerabilities. The most critical is CVE-2025-62215, a Windows Kernel privilege escalation flaw that is confirmed to be actively exploited in the wild. The update also includes critical RCE flaws in Windows GDI+ and Microsoft Office.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      An actively exploited privilege escalation flaw is a critical component of attack chains. Attackers who gain initial low-level access (e.g., via phishing) can use this zero-day to immediately gain full SYSTEM-level control of a machine, bypassing all security and deploying ransomware or spyware.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability is a race condition in the Windows Kernel. An attacker who can run code on a target machine can win this race to elevate their privileges, turning a minor intrusion into a full system compromise.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This is the top patching priority for the month. Direct IT operations to deploy the November Microsoft security updates immediately, focusing on workstations and servers to mitigate this actively exploited zero-day.</p>

    <title>Cisco ISE Zero-Day (CVE-2025-20337) Exploited by Advanced Hackers</title>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/ciscoise/800/400" alt="A secure network identity server with a glowing red vulnerability icon, indicating a breach." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Amazon researchers revealed that a sophisticated threat actor has been exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-20337) in the Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE). This pre-authentication RCE flaw allows attackers to gain full administrator-level access to the compromised ISE system.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a catastrophic breach. Cisco ISE is the central "gatekeeper" for many corporate networks, controlling which users and devices can access which resources (NAC). Compromising it allows attackers to control the entire network, bypass segmentation, and impersonate any user or device.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The flaw is a vulnerable deserialization logic in a previously undocumented endpoint on the ISE. Attackers deployed a custom-built web shell designed specifically to look like a legitimate Cisco component to maintain stealthy, persistent access.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your network security team to immediately apply the patches released by Cisco for ISE. This is a critical risk, and given the targeted nature of the attack, you must assume compromise and hunt for the described web shell and other IoCs.</p>

    <title>CISA Adds 3 Flaws to KEV Catalog (WatchGuard, Gladinet, Microsoft)</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/12/cisa-kev-catalog-watchguard-gladinet-microsoft</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/cisakev/800/400" alt="The CISA logo on a screen with a list of vulnerabilities marked 'Actively Exploited'." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>CISA has added three new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, confirming active exploitation. These include the Windows Kernel zero-day (CVE-2025-62215) from today's Patch Tuesday, a Gladinet Triofox access control flaw (CVE-2025-12480), and a WatchGuard Firebox RCE flaw (CVE-2025-9242).</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      These flaws represent immediate, proven risks. The Gladinet flaw allows attackers to access files on cloud storage platforms. The WatchGuard flaw allows for complete firewall takeover. All three are being actively used by attackers to breach networks.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers prioritize and weaponize vulnerabilities that are internet-facing (like WatchGuard and Gladinet) or provide high-level access (like the Windows Kernel flaw) to maximize their impact and success rate.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your vulnerability management team to prioritize patching these three CVEs immediately. The KEV catalog is not a suggestion; it is a list of active threats. Federal agencies must patch by December 3, 2025, and all organizations should follow suit.</p>

    <title>RansomHouse Claims Attack on H&amp;M, Adidas Yarn Supplier "Fulgar"</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/12/ransomhouse-fulgar-breach-hm-adidas-supplier</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/supplychainhack/800/400" alt="A textile factory with a digital padlock, representing a supply chain ransomware attack." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The RansomHouse cybercrime group has claimed a successful ransomware attack on Fulgar, a major Italian textile supplier for global brands like H&amp;M and Adidas. The company confirmed an attack on Nov 3rd, shutting down its IT systems. RansomHouse is now threatening to leak stolen confidential data.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a critical supply chain attack. The breach at Fulgar not only halts its own operations but also threatens to disrupt the production and supply chains of major global fashion brands that rely on its specialized materials.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Ransomware groups are increasingly targeting critical "choke points" in supply chains. By hitting a key supplier, they inflict maximum financial pressure and create urgency, as the primary target (Fulgar) is also being pressured by its massive clients (H&amp;M, Adidas) to resolve the issue.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review your organization's critical supplier list. Conduct a risk assessment to understand the impact of your top suppliers going offline. Ensure your supply chain contracts include cybersecurity diligence requirements and incident notification clauses.</p>
