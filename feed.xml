      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 has unveiled "The Shadow Campaigns," a coordinated hacking effort by group TGR-STA-1030 that breached government systems in 37 countries. The group focused on ministries of finance, energy, and trade, stealing entire executive inboxes to influence real-world trade negotiations and military operations.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Geopolitical Risk. This isn't just data theft; it's the weaponization of intelligence to shape global economic outcomes. For multinational firms, this means your government-level communications and trade secrets may already be in the hands of a sophisticated adversary.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The attackers used "unflashy" older software flaws that were poorly monitored. By targeting unpatched services and using phishing disguised as official government communiqués, they maintained long-term persistence without detection.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Conduct an immediate "Asset Inventory" to identify every internet-facing system. Prioritize patching older vulnerabilities over chasing zero-days, and implement "Strict Email Isolation" for senior officials handling sensitive trade or policy data.</p>

    <title>"LookOut": Critical RCE Flaws in Google Looker Threaten Corporate Secrets</title>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/looker-vulnerability/800/400" alt="A magnifying glass over a digital brain with a red 'Takeover' alert in a data visualization dashboard." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Researchers at Tenable have disclosed "LookOut," a chain of vulnerabilities in Google's Looker business intelligence platform. The most severe is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw that allows attackers to take full control of a Looker server, accessing sensitive user credentials and the "internal management database" that acts as the central nervous system for corporate data.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Extreme Data Integrity Risk. Looker is used by 60,000+ companies to visualize their most sensitive secrets. A breach here allows an attacker to manipulate corporate data or pivot deep into private internal networks. While Google has patched the cloud version, on-premise users remain exposed.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The platform was tricked into connecting to its own "private brain" through a specialized data-extraction technique, bypassing traditional security barriers between the application and its underlying configuration storage.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> For self-hosted Looker instances, apply security patches immediately. Security teams should inspect the `.git/hooks/` directory for unauthorized scripts (e.g., `pre-push`) and search application logs for unusual SQL errors targeting `looker__ilooker`.</p>

    <title>Moltbook Disaster: 1.5M AI API Tokens Exposed in "Vibe Coding" Failure</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/09/moltbook-ai-agent-data-leak-vibe-coding</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/moltbook-leak/800/400" alt="An open digital book leaking glowing keys and personal email strings into a dark void." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Following an exposé by Wiz, China’s MIIT has issued an emergency alert regarding Moltbook, a social network for AI agents. A misconfigured database left 1.5 million API tokens and 35,000 private emails public. The incident has put "Vibe Coding"—the trend of using AI to build apps fast without security guardrails—under intense scrutiny.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Credential Hijacking Risk. If your developers used corporate API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS) to experiment with "Clawdbots" on Moltbook, those keys are now compromised. Attackers can use these to rack up massive costs or exfiltrate your private AI prompts and training data.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The platform was built following the "vibe" of rapid development. It neglected fundamental identity verification and security defaults because the AI-generated code wasn't audited for enterprise-grade security standards.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Audit all developer usage of "experimental" AI social platforms. Rotate all high-value API tokens immediately. Issue a policy prohibiting the use of corporate credentials in any non-vetted agentic AI platforms.</p>

    <title>Clinic Spy Cam: Ahmedabad Doctor Blackmailed via Default CCTV Passwords</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/09/cctv-default-password-extortion-ahmedabad</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/cctv-blackmail/800/400" alt="A security camera with a red 'Hacked' overlay and a smartphone screen displaying a QR code for ransom." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A doctor in Ahmedabad is being blackmailed with private footage from inside his clinic after hackers (allegedly the original installers) accessed his CCTV system using default passwords. The case follows a similar trend of "Clinic Spy Cams" where sensitive medical footage is held for ransom using WhatsApp and QR code payments.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Severe Privacy and Legal Liability. For medical and professional firms, a breach of physical privacy is a catastrophic brand failure. In Bahrain and India, this could trigger massive fines under emerging DPDP/Data Protection laws regarding sensitive biometric and personal data.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> A classic failure of "Basic Hygiene." Installers retained default credentials, and the client never performed a handover audit. This allowed remote access to the DVR/NVR via standard mobile apps used for surveillance.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Conduct a "Physical Security Audit." Every IoT device (cameras, smart locks, printers) must have its default password changed and be placed on a separate, non-routable VLAN. Never allow installers to retain remote access credentials post-setup.</p>
