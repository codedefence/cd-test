      <p>Google has released emergency security updates for Android to address 107 vulnerabilities, including two high-severity zero-days (CVE-2025-48633 and CVE-2025-48572) that are under limited, targeted exploitation. The flaws affect the Android Framework and allow for information disclosure and privilege escalation.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      These zero-days are likely being used by commercial spyware vendors to target high-value individuals (executives, journalists, government officials). Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain elevated privileges on a device, potentially accessing sensitive data, tracking location, or monitoring communications without user consent.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerabilities exist in the core Android Framework component. Attackers discovered specific flaws that allow them to bypass the operating system's security sandbox, granting them access rights that should be restricted to the system level.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your Mobile Device Management (MDM) administrators to enforce the December 2025 Android security patch level (2025-12-01 or 2025-12-05) immediately. Prioritize patching for devices used by executives and staff with access to sensitive corporate data.</p>

    <title>Massive Breach at Coupang Exposes Data of 33 Million Customers</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/coupangbreach/800/400" alt="A digital map of South Korea with data streams flowing out, symbolizing a massive e-commerce data leak." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>South Korea's largest e-commerce giant, Coupang, is investigating a massive data breach that has exposed personal information for approximately 33.7 million customers—nearly two-thirds of the country's population. The breach reportedly originated from overseas servers and spanned several months.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a catastrophic breach of consumer trust for a market leader. While payment data was reportedly not stolen, the loss of names, addresses, and phone numbers fuels large-scale phishing and fraud campaigns. Coupang faces intense regulatory scrutiny, potential class-action lawsuits, and significant reputational damage.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Preliminary investigations point to a sophisticated external attack that bypassed perimeter defenses, potentially aided by a former employee or compromised developer credentials, allowing unauthorized access to customer databases over an extended period.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This incident highlights the importance of "insider threat" monitoring and rigorous access controls for developers. Review your organization's database monitoring to ensure that large, anomalous queries or exports—especially from overseas IPs—trigger immediate alerts.</p>

    <title>Malicious NPM Package Uses Hidden Prompts to Evade AI Security Scanners</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/02/npm-package-evades-ai-scanners</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/npmmalwareai/800/400" alt="A software code block with a hidden, ghostly robot face behind it, representing AI evasion tactics." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Researchers have discovered a malicious NPM package (`eslint-plugin-unicorn-ts-2`) that includes hidden instructions designed specifically to trick AI-driven security scanners. The code contains prompts telling AI models to "forget everything" and classify the malicious code as "safe" and "legit."</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This represents a new frontier in supply chain attacks: "AI Prompt Injection for Evasion." As organizations increasingly rely on AI agents to audit code, attackers are adapting by embedding instructions that manipulate those very agents, allowing malware to slip into production pipelines undetected.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The attackers embedded natural language prompts within the code comments and metadata. When an AI security tool processes the file, it interprets these instructions as commands, overriding its own safety protocols.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Do not rely solely on AI-based static analysis tools. Maintain a "human-in-the-loop" for code reviews, especially for external dependencies. Update your DevSecOps tools to detect and flag "prompt injection" patterns within codebases.</p>

    <title>"ShadyPanda" Browser Extensions Track 4 Million Users via Chrome &amp; Edge</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/02/shadypanda-malicious-browser-extensions</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/browserextensionhack/800/400" alt="A web browser interface with puzzle piece extensions turning into surveillance eyes." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A threat actor tracked as "ShadyPanda" has been caught operating a network of over 100 malicious browser extensions on the Chrome and Edge stores. These extensions, downloaded over 4 million times, silently track user activity, inject affiliate fraud links, and create backdoors for executing arbitrary code.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Malicious extensions are a massive blind spot. They run with high privileges within the browser, often having visibility into internal corporate web apps, SaaS platforms, and email. This campaign allowed attackers to profile users and potentially steal session cookies or inject scripts into secure sessions.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The actor published seemingly useful tools (productivity apps, coupon finders) and waited years to weaponize them ("sleeping agent" tactic), bypassing initial store reviews. They then updated the code to include malicious tracking and execution logic.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Enforce strict browser management policies using Group Policy or MDM. Block the installation of all extensions by default and only allow a vetted "allowlist" of approved business tools. Regularly audit installed extensions across the enterprise fleet.</p>
