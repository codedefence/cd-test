      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A massive dataset containing the personal information of 17.5 million Instagram users has surfaced on hacker forums. The leak includes usernames, full names, email addresses, and phone numbers. While Meta clarified that their core systems remain secure, the surge in unrequested password reset emails suggests an external party is abusing leaked contact details to trigger account recovery flows.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High. This data provides the perfect "starter kit" for sophisticated spear-phishing and SIM-swapping attacks. Corporate accounts managed via personal credentials are at immediate risk of takeover, which can lead to brand damage and the exfiltration of sensitive DM communications.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The dataset appears to be linked to a 2024 API scraping incident. Threat actors are now weaponizing this "stale" data during the holiday transition, betting on distracted security teams and users.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Mandate a "Social Media Audit" for all staff. Ensure all corporate-linked accounts have hardware-based MFA (FIDO2) enabled. Advise employees to ignore unrequested password reset emails and never click links within them.</p>

    <title>Rs 547 Crore Cyber-Laundering Racket Busted; 18 Mule Accounts Frozen</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Indian law enforcement has dismantled an international cyber-laundering syndicate that diverted over Rs 547 crore to handlers in Cambodia and other regions via cryptocurrency. The racket lured youngsters into opening "mule accounts" under the guise of job offers, using these accounts to funnel stolen funds from various cyber scams.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This highlights the increasing industrialization of "Scam-as-a-Service." For financial institutions, it underscores the critical need for "Liveness Detection" and behavioral analytics during account onboarding to flag mule activity before funds are exfiltrated via crypto-channels.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The syndicate exploited the "Job Fraud" vector—a growing trend in 2026—to recruit innocent participants as money mules, effectively shielding the primary actors behind layers of domestic bank accounts.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Enhance your "Know Your Customer" (KYC) protocols with AI-driven liveness checks. Implement real-time monitoring for high-velocity transfers to newly opened accounts, especially those with no prior transaction history.</p>

    <title>CISA KEV Alert: HPE OneView CVSS 10.0 Exploit Active in the Wild</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/12/cisa-kev-hpe-oneview-critical</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CISA has added a maximum-severity remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in HPE OneView (CVE-2025-37164) to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to gain complete control over the infrastructure management platform. Exploitation has accelerated as threat actors shift focus from endpoints to management layers.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Catastrophic. Compromising OneView allows an attacker to seize control of all managed servers, storage, and networking. This is a "keys to the kingdom" scenario that can lead to total operational paralysis and massive data exfiltration.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Attackers are increasingly targeting centralized management tools because they are often internet-exposed and provide a high "blast radius" for a single exploit.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Direct your IT teams to apply vendor patches for HPE OneView immediately. Ensure that all management interfaces are isolated from the public internet and require MFA for access.</p>

    <title>New Crypto Compliance: FIU-IND Mandates Mandatory Cyber Audits</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/12/fiu-ind-crypto-compliance-audit</link>
    <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/12/fiu-ind-crypto-compliance-audit</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/crypto-audit-2026/800/400" alt="A golden Bitcoin icon being scanned by a digital magnifying glass over a compliance report." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) has released updated anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines for the virtual digital asset (VDA) sector. Key changes include mandatory annual cybersecurity audits by CERT-In accredited professionals and stricter "Know Your Customer" (KYC) requirements, including geo-location data and OTP verification.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Significant. These rules formalize the "security-first" requirement for the crypto industry. For your clients in the VDA space, this increases compliance costs but provides a structured framework to build investor trust and resilience against hacks like the 2024 WazirX incident.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Rising incidents of crypto-linked money laundering and high-profile exchange hacks have forced regulators to move from "taxation-only" oversight to rigorous technical auditing.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> If your organization handles digital assets, schedule a pre-compliance audit with a CERT-In accredited partner immediately. Review your onboarding flow to ensure it captures the newly required geolocation and liveness data points.</p>
