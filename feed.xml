Your browser update cycle is now a race against active exploitation. 🌐

CVE-2026-2441 · Severity 8.8 · Active zero-day exploitation of the Chromium engine's CSS component.

We are seeing attackers leverage this memory corruption flaw to achieve remote code execution. Because this affects the core engine, browsers like @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) Chrome and @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) Edge are both vulnerable until updated.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog update confirms that this is being used in targeted attacks right now. A simple visit to a malicious page is enough to trigger a full system compromise.

The uncomfortable truth: Your users are the perimeter, and a single delayed browser patch can nullify millions in security investments.

→ Force a global update for all Chromium-based browsers to version 122.0.6261.94 or higher.
→ Monitor for anomalous browser crashes which may indicate failed heap spray attempts.
→ Enable auto-update policies across all enterprise managed endpoints today.

Have you verified that your browser auto-update policies are actually functioning across your fleet? 👇

If attackers own your remote access, they own your entire domain. 🔓

CVE-2026-1731 · Severity 9.9 · Critical unauthenticated remote code execution in @[BeyondTrust](urn:li:organization:12625) Remote Support.

We are seeing mass exploitation attempts against self-hosted appliances within 24 hours of proof-of-concept release. This is no longer a theoretical risk; it is an active threat to your infrastructure.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has moved this to the KEV list with an immediate remediation deadline. Attackers are using this entry point to bypass identity checks and gain full administrative persistence.

The uncomfortable truth: The tools you trust to provide secure access are now the most targeted gateways into your internal network.

→ Patch all self-hosted Remote Support and PRA appliances to version BT26-02 immediately.
→ Restrict appliance management portals to known IP ranges or internal-only access.
→ Audit your service account logs for any unusual lateral movement originating from support nodes.

Is your remote access infrastructure currently internet-exposed without secondary IP restrictions? 👇

Your virtualization backups are now a primary target for state actors. 🛡️

CVE-2026-22769 · Severity 10.0 · Hard-coded credentials in @[Dell Technologies](urn:li:organization:1193) RecoverPoint for VMs.

We are tracking a suspected China-nexus threat cluster that has been quietly exploiting this zero-day. This flaw allows for full system takeover without any user interaction required.

Intelligence from @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) Threat Intelligence suggests this activity has been ongoing since mid-2024. If you use this for disaster recovery, your entire failover environment is at risk.

The uncomfortable truth: Hard-coded credentials in enterprise-grade software remain a systemic risk that bypasses even the best MFA.

→ Update all @[Dell Technologies](urn:li:organization:1193) RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines to version 6.0.3.1 HF1.
→ Rotate all administrative credentials used within the RecoverPoint management console.
→ Conduct a retrospective search for unauthorized logins dating back to June 2024.

Have you audited your disaster recovery environment for unauthorized configuration changes? 👇

Your simple text editor just became a high-risk entry point. 📝

CVE-2026-20841 · Severity 7.8 · Remote code execution via Markdown links in Windows 11 Notepad.

We are seeing attackers distribute crafted Markdown files that trigger unverified protocol launches. One click on a "README" file is enough to initiate a malicious file download on @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) systems.

The latest Patch Tuesday update addresses this, but only for the Store-updated version of the app. This vulnerability illustrates how even basic native apps are now being weaponized.

The uncomfortable truth: If you don't restrict protocol handlers, any app that can render a link becomes a potential execution vector.

→ Update the Notepad App via the Microsoft Store to version 11.2510 or higher.
→ Block high-risk protocol handlers like ms-appinstaller at the operating system level.
→ Audit your environment for unexpected parent-child process chains involving Notepad.exe.

Do you currently restrict which protocol handlers are allowed to launch on corporate endpoints? 👇
