      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> JFrog researchers have surfaced a pair of critical vulnerabilities in n8n, a popular workflow automation platform utilized for AI-driven tasks. The most severe, CVE-2026-1470 (CVSS 9.9), allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by exploiting the way the platform handles LLM-generated inputs within its execution sandbox.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Extreme. Many enterprises use n8n to automate sensitive business processes (e.g., HR, Finance, DevSecOps). An RCE here grants attackers full access to your automation "brain," allowing them to steal API keys, exfiltrate data, or pivot into other connected SaaS tools.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The platform failed to sufficiently sanitize inputs before passing them to the execution engine, particularly when those inputs were processed or generated by an integrated Large Language Model (LLM).</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Update all self-hosted n8n instances to version 1.74.2 or higher immediately. For cloud-hosted versions, verify with the vendor that the patch has been applied and rotate any high-privilege credentials used in your workflows.</p>

    <title>Metro4Shell: Hackers Exploit React Native CLI for Supply-Chain Attacks</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/metro4shell/800/400" alt="A mobile app development environment showing a red code injection into a terminal." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A critical security flaw, dubbed "Metro4Shell," has been discovered in the Metro Development Server used within the popular "@react-native-community/cli" npm package. Threat actors are actively exploiting this RCE flaw to compromise developer workstations during the build process, allowing for the silent injection of malicious code into mobile applications.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Supply-Chain Risk. If your developers use React Native, their local machines are vulnerable to a takeover. More dangerously, the apps they build and publish to the App Store or Play Store could be "backdoored" before they even leave the developer's laptop.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The Metro server implementation lacked sufficient origin-validation on certain development-only endpoints, allowing a malicious website visited by a developer to "bridge" into their local development environment.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Mandate an immediate audit of all internal npm registries and developer environments. Enforce an update to the latest patched version of the React Native CLI and ensure developers are not running development servers on publicly accessible network interfaces.</p>

    <title>France Dumps Zoom and Teams as EU Pivots to Digital Sovereignty</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/03/france-eu-digital-sovereignty-teams-zoom-exit</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/digital-sovereignty/800/400" alt="A French flag overlaying a digital shield blocking major US tech logos." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In a major blow to US Big Tech, France has announced that 2.5 million civil servants will stop using Zoom and Microsoft Teams by 2027 in favor of a homegrown, "sovereign" video conferencing system. This follows similar moves by the Austrian military and German state administrations to adopt open-source or domestic alternatives to ensure data privacy and digital autonomy.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This signals a permanent fragmentation of the global software market. For your clients in Bahrain with European operations, compliance with "Data Residency" and "Sovereignty" will no longer be optional—it will be a prerequisite for doing business with government entities.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Geopolitical tensions and fears that Silicon Valley giants could be compelled to cut off access (a concern heightened by recent US-Greenland tensions) have catalyzed the EU's drive for independence from non-European tech dependencies.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Begin evaluating "Sovereign Cloud" or open-source alternatives for your primary communication and collaboration tools. Diversifying your vendor stack now will prevent an "emergency migration" if regional data laws tighten in the coming 12-18 months.</p>

    <title>Critical KiloView Flaw (CVE-2026-1453): Full Admin Control at Risk</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/03/kiloview-vulnerability-full-admin-control</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/kiloview-exploit/800/400" alt="An industrial video encoder icon with a red warning light and a digital padlock icon." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A severe vulnerability (CVE-2026-1453, CVSS 9.8) has been identified in KiloView video encoding and distribution hardware. The flaw, which stems from a lack of authentication for critical administrative functions, allows remote attackers to gain full control of the device, enabling them to disrupt broadcasts or use the hardware as a pivot point into secure networks.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High for media, surveillance, and corporate event sectors. A compromise of these encoders can lead to "On-Air" sabotage or the silent exfiltration of private video feeds. It represents a significant OT (Operational Technology) risk in facilities using professional A/V gear.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Insecure default configurations and a missing authentication layer on the device's web-based management console allowed for unauthorized remote access.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Audit all KiloView hardware on your network. Immediately isolate these devices from the public internet and place them on a restricted management VLAN with strict access control lists (ACLs) until a firmware patch is validated and applied.</p>
