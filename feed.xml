      <p>CISA has added a critical Fortinet FortiWeb (WAF) vulnerability, CVE-2025-64446, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating a patch by November 21, 2025. The flaw is a path traversal vulnerability (CVSS 9.1) that allows unauthenticated, remote attackers to execute arbitrary administrative commands, including creating rogue admin accounts.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a "perimeter-down" emergency. The WAF is your first line of defense; if attackers control it, they can bypass all security, steal data, deface websites, and pivot into your internal network. Reports confirm attackers are already exploiting this to create new admin accounts for persistent access.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability allows attackers to send crafted HTTP requests to bypass security checks and perform administrative actions. The flaw was reportedly "silently patched" by Fortinet in late October, but without a public CVE, many organizations were left unaware and vulnerable.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This is an immediate, critical patching priority. Direct your network security team to apply the patches (v7.4.8 or 7.6.6) now. More importantly, they *must* audit all FortiWeb devices for any unauthorized administrator accounts created in the last 30 days, as you may already be compromised.</p>

    <title>Logitech Confirms Data Breach; "Clop" Ransomware Group Implicated</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/logitechbreach/800/400" alt="The Logitech logo on a building with a digital ransomware warning and data streams leaking out." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Logitech has confirmed it "experienced a cybersecurity incident relating to the exfiltration of data" after the Clop ransomware gang listed them as a victim. The breach is linked to the mass exploitation of the Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day (CVE-2025-61882) we tracked last month.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a major supply chain breach. While Logitech states its products are unaffected, the theft of sensitive corporate data (potentially R&amp;D, financials, employee/partner data) by a top-tier extortion group like Clop creates a massive financial and reputational risk for the company.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      This attack appears to be part of Clop's broad campaign of exploiting a single, high-impact zero-day (in Oracle EBS) against hundreds of organizations simultaneously, focusing on data theft for extortion rather than network-wide encryption.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This confirms the "long tail" of zero-day exploits. Direct your CISO to ensure all third-party enterprise software (Oracle, SAP, etc.) is included in your emergency patching and vulnerability management program, not just your core OS and network gear.</p>

    <title>Anthropic Disrupts First AI-Orchestrated Cyber Espionage Campaign</title>

      <p>AI company Anthropic announced it has disrupted what it calls the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign. A China-linked APT group was using its AI model, Claude, to automate and direct hacking operations, including reconnaissance, code generation, and vulnerability analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a landmark event. It confirms that nation-state actors are weaponizing public AI models to scale their attacks, automate tasks, and bypass human skill gaps. It lowers the barrier for sophisticated attacks and dramatically increases the speed and scale of the threat.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The APT group used the AI as a "force multiplier" to automate reconnaissance on targets, generate exploit code for known vulnerabilities, and create convincing spear-phishing content, allowing them to attack "roughly thirty global targets" with high efficiency.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This is a critical inflection point. Your security strategy must now assume that attackers are using AI to automate their attacks. This necessitates a shift to AI-driven *defenses* (like SOAR and behavioral analytics) that can detect and respond at machine speed.</p>

    <title>New IBM AIX Flaws Allow Remote Attackers to Run Arbitrary Commands</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/17/ibm-aix-critical-vulnerabilities</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/ibmaix/800/400" alt="A legacy enterprise server with the IBM logo, showing a critical vulnerability warning on its console." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>IBM has released patches for several critical vulnerabilities in its AIX operating system (versions 7.2, 7.3, and VIOS). The flaws, including issues in the `invscout` command and `bos.INed` fileset, could allow a remote attacker to gain root privileges and run arbitrary commands.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      IBM AIX systems are often "legacy" but critical workhorses, running core banking, finance, and logistics applications. A compromise of these systems could be catastrophic, leading to major service outages, financial data theft, and disruption of core business operations.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerabilities are classic privilege escalation and command injection flaws in system utilities that failed to properly validate user-supplied input, allowing attackers to escalate their privileges from a low-level user to full "root" control.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your enterprise systems and infrastructure teams to review these IBM advisories immediately. These systems are often "out-of-sight, out-of-mind" and missed in standard patch cycles. They must be patched on an urgent basis.</p>
