Your SD-WAN fabric has been an open target for over three years. 🛡️

CVE-2026-20127 · Severity 10.0 · Critical Authentication Bypass in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.

Evidence released in the last 24 hours confirms that a sophisticated threat actor has been exploiting @[Cisco](urn:li:organization:1063) SD-WAN controllers since at least 2023. The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has issued Emergency Directive 26-03, mandating immediate federal action. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to gain root-level access by sending crafted requests to the management plane.

Attackers are using this access to add rogue peers and manipulate network policies across entire enterprise fabrics. If your management interfaces are reachable from the public internet, they should be considered compromised until proven otherwise.

The uncomfortable truth: A three-year-old zero-day in your core network fabric means your historical traffic data and network segmentation may have been visible to an adversary for years.

→ Patch all Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager and Controller instances to the fixed release immediately.
→ Conduct a deep forensic audit of controller logs for unauthorized peer additions or version downgrades.
→ Strictly isolate all SD-WAN management interfaces from the public internet.

Have you audited your SD-WAN controller for unauthorized peer relationships this weekend? 👇

Leaked cloud keys are exposing your private AI data to the public. 🔑

Thousands of @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) Cloud API keys found embedded in client-side code allow unauthorized Gemini AI access.

New research has identified nearly 3,000 active Google API keys that can be abused to authenticate to sensitive Gemini endpoints. These keys, often intended only for maps or billing, provide a direct path for attackers to access private data and execute unauthorized AI queries.

This exposure demonstrates a critical misunderstanding of how API permissions propagate across cloud environments. Attackers are currently scanning for these "AIza" prefixed keys to bypass authentication and siphon data from enterprise AI deployments.

The uncomfortable truth: Your developers' convenience in embedding "temporary" keys is creating a permanent hole in your AI data privacy.

→ Scan all public repositories and client-side code for "AIza" prefixed Google Cloud API keys.
→ Rotate any exposed keys immediately and implement strict API restrictions in the GCP console.
→ Use secret management tools to prevent API keys from ever being hardcoded into production code.

Do you have a real-time inventory of every API key currently active in your cloud environment? 👇

One click is still enough to bypass your entire Windows security stack. 🔓

CVE-2026-21514 · Severity 7.8 · Active exploitation of OLE bypass in Microsoft Word.

Attackers are actively utilizing this @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) zero-day to deliver malware via crafted Office documents. By exploiting a failure in OLE mitigations, this vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the security prompts that would normally warn a user about dangerous content.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has confirmed this is being used in live phishing campaigns to deliver ransomware and infostealers. When the operating system fails to provide a warning, the "human firewall" is effectively neutralized.

The uncomfortable truth: If your security strategy depends on users spotting malicious files, you have no defense against an exploit that silences the system's own warnings.

→ Apply the February 2026 Microsoft security updates to all Office installations immediately.
→ Enforce Protected View for all documents originating from the internet or external email.
→ Disable OLE object execution via Group Policy for all non-essential business units.

Are you still relying on user training to catch what the OS should be blocking? 👇

Your simple text editor is now a high-risk remote execution point. 📝

CVE-2026-20841 · Severity 7.8 · Remote code execution via Markdown links in Windows 11 Notepad.

We are seeing a surge in attacks utilizing trojanized "README" files that exploit improper protocol handling in the @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) Notepad Store app. A single click on a crafted Markdown link can trigger a remote file download and execution.

This vulnerability illustrates how even the most basic native applications are now being weaponized to bypass traditional perimeter defenses. If your organization relies on automated Store app updates, your patching may be lagging behind the active threat.

The uncomfortable truth: Every application on your endpoint that can render a link is a potential remote execution engine for an attacker.

→ Update the Microsoft Notepad App via the Store to version 11.2510 or higher today.
→ Restrict the use of high-risk protocol handlers (like ms-appinstaller) at the OS level.
→ Audit your environment for unexpected process chains originating from notepad.exe.

Do you treat your native Windows App updates with the same urgency as your core OS patches? 👇
