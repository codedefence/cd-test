    <title>CERT-In High-Risk Warning: Chrome Background Fetch API (CVE-2026-1504)</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has issued a high-severity alert for Google Chrome (CVE-2026-1504). The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of the Background Fetch API, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a user's system via a specially crafted request.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High. This flaw allows for "Zero-Click" style entry if a user visits a compromised or malicious site. For corporate environments, this represents a significant endpoint threat that could lead to full system takeover and lateral movement across the internal network.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The Background Fetch API, designed for large downloads in the background, lacked sufficient validation, creating a memory corruption pathway that attackers can exploit to bypass browser sandboxing.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Force-update all corporate browsers to version 144.0.7559.109 (or newer) immediately. Audit web logs for unusual traffic patterns originating from the Background Fetch service.</p>

    <title>CISA KEV Addition: Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile Code Injection (CVE-2026-1281)</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CISA has added CVE-2026-1281 to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. This critical flaw in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) allows for unauthenticated code injection. Active exploitation has been detected in the wild, primarily targeting government and high-value corporate mobile fleets.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Critical. Since EPMM manages mobile device policy and access, a compromise here allows an attacker to push malicious apps or configurations to every managed smartphone in the organization, bypassing all mobile security controls.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Improper input validation in the administrative API allowed attackers to inject commands that are executed with system-level privileges on the management appliance.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Patch Ivanti EPMM instances within 24 hours. For clients in the GCC, isolate the management interface from the public internet and verify that no unauthorized administrative accounts were created in the last 48 hours.</p>

    <title>Digital Census Launch: New "App-Based" Data Collection Expands Risk Surface</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/31/digital-census-2026-cyber-risk-spotlight</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The transition to app-based and web-based data collection for the 2026 Census has significantly expanded the national risk surface. Experts warn that the first layer of defense lies at the device level, citing risks of data leaks, system disruption, and insider threats from temporary enumerators.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Reputational Risk for Vendors. With multiple technology and software providers involved, a vulnerability in a single component could cascade. For the public, a breach would erode trust in government administrative exercises for a decade.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The move away from paper schedules to mobile platforms introduces complex supply-chain risks and requires real-time access management that traditional government IT is not always equipped to handle at scale.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Ensure rigorous "Least Privilege" access controls for all temporary census staff. Implement real-time monitoring for application-level anomalies and conduct daily forensic audits of data egress points.</p>

    <title>CERT-In Warning for macOS: Vulnerabilities in Pages and Keynote (CVE-2025-46316)</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/31/cert-in-macos-productivity-apps-alert</link>
    <pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/apple-pages/800/400" alt="The Apple Pages logo with a red digital glitch effect and a warning triangle." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CERT-In has flagged serious software vulnerabilities in Apple's Pages and Keynote for macOS (CVE-2025-46316 and CVE-2025-46306). These out-of-bounds read errors in the QuickLook component allow attackers to steal sensitive data if a user is tricked into opening a specially crafted file.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Medium-High. Since these are primary productivity tools, malicious documents sent via email or chat could be used to exfiltrate trade secrets or user credentials from macOS workstations.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Flaws in the way the QuickLook component processes file metadata allowed for unauthorized memory access, leading to information exposure.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Mandate updates for Pages and Keynote to version 15.1 on all macOS Sequoia 15.6+ systems. Advise staff to avoid opening unrequested .pages or .key files from external sources.</p>
