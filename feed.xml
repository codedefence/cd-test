      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Google has confirmed that over 40% of all active Android devices—more than one billion phones—are no longer receiving critical security updates. Devices running Android 12 or older are now permanently vulnerable to new malware and spyware strains, as manufacturers end support for legacy hardware.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High "Shadow IT" Risk. Many employees use personal older phones for work (BYOD). These devices are now gateways for credential theft and corporate data exfiltration. In Bahrain, where legacy devices are common in the workforce, this poses a direct threat to enterprise perimeters.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The natural "end-of-life" cycle for mobile hardware has hit a massive bottleneck. Phones introduced before 2021 lack the hardware security modules required for modern Android versions, leaving a billion-user gap for attackers to exploit.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Update your BYOD policy to mandate Android 13 or newer for any device accessing corporate email or VPNs. Conduct an audit of "Work Profile" enrollments to identify and phase out unsupported hardware.</p>

    <title>Google Threat Intel: State-Sponsored Hackers "Personalizing" Defense Attacks</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A new Google report reveals a "relentless barrage" of cyber operations against US and EU industrial supply chains. State-sponsored groups from Russia, North Korea, and China are moving away from broad attacks to "personalized" targeting of individual employees via spoofed job portals and AI-enhanced social engineering.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Intellectual Property Risk. This isn't just about breaking into servers; it's about tricking engineers and consultants into giving up access. For defense contractors in the GCC, this means your "softest" targets are now individual staff members' personal lives and career ambitions.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Traditional perimeter defenses have become too strong, forcing nation-state actors to weaponize "Human Intelligence" (HUMINT) via digital means. They are profiling targets for weeks before launching highly tailored phishing lures.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Implement "Executive Protection" monitoring for high-value targets (HVT). Deploy AI-driven anti-phishing tools that can detect the subtle linguistic markers of state-sponsored social engineering.</p>

    <title>CISA Perimeter Alert: Feds Ordered to Disconnect Unsupported Edge Devices</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/10/cisa-disconnect-unsupported-network-edge-devices</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CISA has issued a Binding Operational Directive ordering federal agencies to identify and disconnect all "End-of-Life" (EoL) routers, firewalls, and network appliances. The move comes after intelligence showed hackers are increasingly using these unpatchable edge devices as persistent backdoors into secure networks.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Operational Disruption vs. Security. Many firms "sweat" their hardware assets for 10+ years. This directive makes it clear: EoL hardware is a liability that cannot be mitigated with software. For your clients, this is a call to audit "Legacy Debt" that could lead to an unpatchable breach.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> "Living off the Land" (LotL) techniques have evolved. Attackers no longer need malware; they just need a device that doesn't receive security updates to act as a permanent, invisible node on your network.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Conduct a "Network Edge Audit" this week. Any device that no longer receives manufacturer security patches must be scheduled for immediate decommissioning or moved to a fully isolated "Management-only" network.</p>

    <title>Picus Labs Red Report 2026: Shift from Encryption to "Identity Hijacking"</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/10/picus-labs-red-report-2026-identity-theft-shift</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/identity-hijack/800/400" alt="A digital keycard being duplicated by a shadow figure in a high-tech office hallway." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Picus Labs Red Report 2026 highlights a definitive shift in the threat landscape. Ransomware and file encryption are being deprioritized by top-tier attackers in favor of "Identity Hijacking." Attackers are now focused on stealing session tokens and bypassing MFA to remain silent and persistent within cloud environments.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High. Traditional "Ransomware Protection" (backups) won't help if an attacker is silently using an executive's identity to sign off on fraudulent wires or steal trade secrets over months. This requires a shift from "File Security" to "Behavioral Identity Analytics."</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Enterprises have become better at recovering from encryption (backups), making it less profitable for attackers. However, "Identity" remains the weakest link in the cloud-first, hybrid-work era.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Prioritize the deployment of "Identity Threat Detection and Response" (ITDR) tools. Move beyond simple MFA to "Phishing-Resistant" hardware keys (FIDO2) for all privileged accounts.</p>
