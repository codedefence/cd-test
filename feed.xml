      <p>CISA and FortiGuard Labs have issued urgent alerts regarding a new command injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-58034) in Fortinet's FortiWeb Web Application Firewall. The flaw is being actively exploited in the wild, allowing authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the CLI or HTTP requests.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a critical risk to perimeter security. Compromising the WAF allows attackers to intercept sensitive traffic, manipulate web applications, and potentially pivot into the internal network. Since it is actively exploited, unpatched devices are likely already being targeted.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability stems from improper input sanitization in the management interface, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands that the system executes with high privileges.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct network security teams to apply the Fortinet patches immediately. Ensure management interfaces are not exposed to the public internet. Review logs for any suspicious administrative activity or unexpected command execution.</p>

    <title>Dubai's NAFFCO Hit by Ransomware; 1TB of Data Stolen</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/20/naffco-ransomware-attack-data-leak</link>

      <p>The INC Ransomware gang has claimed responsibility for an attack on NAFFCO, one of the world's leading producers of fire safety equipment (protecting landmarks like the Burj Khalifa). The group claims to have exfiltrated 1TB of sensitive internal data and has listed the company on its leak site.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This breach poses significant risks to critical infrastructure safety and supply chains in the Middle East. The stolen data could include detailed building safety plans, client lists, and proprietary engineering designs, potentially exposing high-profile clients to physical and cyber risks.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      INC Ransomware typically targets organizations with high-value data for double extortion. They likely gained access via compromised credentials or unpatched external-facing services, focusing on data theft to force a payout.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Organizations in the region relying on NAFFCO for safety systems should monitor for potential vendor-related phishing or supply chain risks. Review physical security system integrations to ensure they are segmented from corporate IT networks.</p>

    <title>New "Sturnus" Android Trojan Enables Full Device Takeover</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/20/sturnus-android-trojan-banking-fraud</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/androidmalware/800/400" alt="An Android smartphone displaying a banking app login screen that is being overlaid by malicious code." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Researchers have identified "Sturnus," a new, sophisticated Android banking trojan. This malware is capable of stealing credentials, bypassing encrypted messaging apps to capture communications, and granting attackers full remote control over the infected device to conduct financial fraud.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Sturnus represents a severe threat to mobile banking and corporate BYOD environments. Its ability to bypass encryption and control devices remotely makes it highly effective at stealing MFA codes and authorizing fraudulent transactions without the user's knowledge.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The malware abuses Android's Accessibility Services to read screen content and perform clicks on behalf of the attacker. It is likely distributed via malicious apps sideloaded or disguised as legitimate utilities.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Reinforce mobile security policies. Prohibit the installation of apps from unknown sources (sideloading) on corporate devices. Deploy Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) solutions capable of detecting abuse of Accessibility Services.</p>

    <title>Ransomware Shift: Attacks on Healthcare Now Prioritize Data Extortion Over Encryption</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/20/healthcare-ransomware-shift-data-extortion</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/healthcareransom/800/400" alt="A digital medical record on a tablet with a 'Data Stolen' warning, symbolizing the shift to extortion." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A new report from Sophos reveals a strategic shift in attacks against healthcare: extortion without encryption has tripled since 2023. Attackers are increasingly stealing sensitive patient data to demand ransoms, rather than encrypting systems which triggers immediate alarms and recovery protocols.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This tactic allows attackers to stay undetected longer (higher dwell time) and avoids the complexity of decrypting systems. For healthcare providers, the regulatory fines (HIPAA/GDPR) and reputational damage from a massive data leak can be as costly as operational downtime.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Improved backup strategies in healthcare have made encryption less effective as a bargaining chip. Attackers have pivoted to weaponizing the privacy of patient data, knowing that the threat of a leak is a powerful extortion tool.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Shift focus from purely "anti-ransomware" (anti-encryption) tools to Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and outlier detection. Monitor for large, unauthorized data exfiltration events. Ensure patient data is encrypted at rest to mitigate the impact of theft.</p>

    <title>ENISA Designated as CVE Root Authority for Europe</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/20/enisa-becomes-cve-root-authority</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/enisacve/800/400" alt="The ENISA logo displayed on a European Union flag background, symbolizing cybersecurity leadership." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has been officially designated as a CVE Root Numbering Authority (CNA). This grants ENISA the authority to assign CVE IDs and manage vulnerability disclosures for the EU region, strengthening Europe's role in global vulnerability management.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This decentralizes the vulnerability reporting process, previously dominated by US-based MITRE. It promises faster, more coordinated disclosure handling for European technology vendors and ensures that EU-specific threats and products are prioritized in the global vulnerability ecosystem.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      This is part of the EU's broader strategy to achieve digital sovereignty and strengthen its cybersecurity resilience under frameworks like the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). It ensures Europe has direct control over critical vulnerability intelligence.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      For EU-based organizations and vendors: Update your vulnerability disclosure policies to align with ENISA's new role. Expect stricter and more streamlined reporting requirements for vulnerabilities discovered in EU products.</p>
