      <p>CISA has issued a major alert warning that threat actors are actively leveraging commercial spyware and Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to compromise high-value users of Signal and WhatsApp. Attackers are using sophisticated social engineering to trick victims into installing payloads that grant full access to encrypted communications.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This undermines the perceived security of end-to-end encrypted messaging apps often used by executives for sensitive discussions. Successful compromise allows attackers to read messages, track location, and record calls, posing a severe risk of espionage and data leakage.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers are bypassing encryption by compromising the endpoint device itself. Techniques include exploiting "linked device" features and using zero-click exploits to install spyware that captures data before it is encrypted.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review mobile security policies for executives and high-risk staff. Mandate "Lockdown Mode" on iOS devices where appropriate. Regularly audit "linked devices" in messaging apps and strictly prohibit the installation of unknown apps or configuration profiles.</p>

    <title>"Shai Hulud" Supply Chain Attack Hits 28,000+ GitHub Repositories</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/github-attack/800/400" alt="A network of code repositories on a dark background, with many nodes turning malicious red." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A massive automated supply chain attack, dubbed "Shai Hulud," has flooded GitHub and the npm registry. Attackers have poisoned over 28,000 repositories and 800+ npm packages with malicious code designed to steal developer credentials and secrets upon installation.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a wide-scale contamination of the open-source ecosystem. Developers who inadvertently use these poisoned packages introduce malware directly into the corporate build pipeline, leading to the theft of API keys, cloud tokens, and source code.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers used automated scripts to create thousands of fake repositories and packages with names similar to popular libraries (typosquatting) or by repacking legitimate code with malware, exploiting the implicit trust developers place in open-source registries.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct DevOps leads to block the installation of new or unvetted npm packages immediately. Implement a private package proxy (like Artifactory or Nexus) with malware scanning enabled. Audit build logs for any suspicious outbound connections.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Warns of Novel Risks in New "Agentic AI" Features</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/25/microsoft-warns-agentic-ai-risks</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/agentic-ai/800/400" alt="A futuristic interface showing autonomous AI agents performing tasks, with a warning triangle overlay." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>As Microsoft rolls out new "Agentic AI" capabilities (Copilot Actions) that can autonomously perform tasks on a user's behalf, the company has issued a transparent warning about novel security risks. These include the potential for AI agents to be tricked into performing unauthorized actions via prompt injection.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      The shift from "chatty" AI to "agentic" AI (agents that *do* things) introduces significant operational risk. A compromised agent could automatically delete files, send emails, or change configuration settings without direct human approval, scaling the impact of an attack.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      AI agents operate with the user's permissions. If an attacker can manipulate the agent's instructions (e.g., via a malicious email the agent reads), the agent becomes a "confused deputy," executing the attacker's will using legitimate access.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Adopt a "human-in-the-loop" policy for high-impact AI actions. Ensure that any new AI agent features are deployed in isolated environments first. Review Microsoft's new security guidance for Copilot Actions before broad rollout.</p>

    <title>WhatsApp API Flaw Allowed Scraping of 3.5 Billion User Profiles</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/25/whatsapp-api-scraping-3-5-billion-profiles</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/whatsapp-data/800/400" alt="A massive database of user profile photos and text scrolling rapidly on a screen." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Researchers have disclosed a weakness in WhatsApp's API that allowed the scraping of public profile data (photos, "about" text, and status) from up to 3.5 billion accounts. While not a breach of private messages, this massive dataset helps attackers build detailed profiles for social engineering.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This data is a goldmine for phishers. By correlating profile photos and status updates, attackers can craft highly personalized spear-phishing campaigns targeting employees. It also poses a physical security risk if "about" text or statuses reveal location or travel plans.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The API lacked sufficient rate limiting or privacy controls to prevent automated tools from querying millions of phone numbers to harvest public profile information at scale.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Advise employees to restrict their WhatsApp privacy settings. Profile photos and "About" information should be set to "My Contacts" or "Nobody" rather than "Everyone" to mitigate the risk of reconnaissance by threat actors.</p>

    <title>Delta Dental Breach Exposes 146,000+ Customers via MOVEit Fallout</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/25/delta-dental-breach-moveit-fallout</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/dental-breach/800/400" alt="A dental office reception desk with a digital screen showing a 'System Compromised' alert." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Delta Dental of Virginia has reported a significant data breach affecting over 146,000 customers. The breach is part of the long tail of the MOVEit file transfer vulnerability attacks. Exposed data includes names, member IDs, and potentially sensitive health information.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This incident highlights the persistent, long-term liability of supply chain vulnerabilities. Even months or years after a major flaw is disclosed, the downstream impact of stolen data continues to trigger regulatory reporting requirements, fines, and class-action lawsuits.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers exploited the critical MOVEit Transfer vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362) to exfiltrate data files before patches could be applied. The complex nature of third-party data handling meant the full scope of the impact took time to identify.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Ensure your organization has fully remediated all systems related to the MOVEit vulnerability. Conduct a retrospective audit of all file transfer logs from that period to ensure no data exfiltration events were missed in the initial response.</p>
