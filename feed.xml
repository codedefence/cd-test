Your webmail is a silent doorway for state-sponsored espionage. 📧

CVE-2025-49113 · Severity 9.9 · Critical Remote Code Execution in Roundcube Webmail.

We are seeing attackers leverage this deserialization flaw to take full control of affected systems. This vulnerability was recently added to the @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) KEV catalog due to rapid weaponization by advanced threat groups.

Attackers are targeting unpatched webmail servers to steal login credentials and spy on sensitive communications. With millions of potential targets, the window for remediation before a full compromise is closing.

The uncomfortable truth: Your webmail is the most direct path for an attacker to compromise your corporate identity and internal communications.

→ Patch Roundcube Webmail to the latest security version 1.6.11 or 1.5.10 immediately.
→ Audit your mail server logs for unauthorized PHP object deserialization attempts.
→ Force a password reset for all users if your server was exposed and unpatched.

Have you confirmed that your webmail infrastructure is running the latest security patches? 👇

If attackers own your remote access, they own your network. 🔓

CVE-2026-1731 · Severity 9.9 · Critical unauthenticated RCE in BeyondTrust Remote Support.

We are seeing a massive surge in exploitation attempts against @[BeyondTrust](urn:li:organization:12625) instances as ransomware groups integrate this into their playbooks. The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has issued an urgent remediation warning due to the observed delivery of SparkRAT and VShell payloads.

Attackers are currently deploying persistent backdoors that allow for full administrative takeover without a valid login. This vulnerability highlights the extreme risk of maintaining internet-exposed management tools.

The uncomfortable truth: The software you use to secure your environment is becoming the most effective doorway for a full-scale ransomware attack.

→ Patch all self-hosted Remote Support and PRA appliances to version BT26-02 immediately.
→ Restrict appliance web management access to known IP ranges or a secure VPN only.
→ Conduct a retrospective forensic search for unauthorized admin account creation.

Is your remote access infrastructure currently internet-exposed without secondary IP restrictions? 👇

A single unauthenticated request can now compromise your web server. 🐚

React2Shell · Severity Critical · Remote Code Execution in React Server Components.

We are tracking a global wave of scanning activity as threat actors seek to exploit the React2Shell vulnerability. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to take full control of vulnerable web servers with no more than a single request.

Reports indicate that state-sponsored actors from multiple regions have already begun exploiting this in cloud and enterprise environments. Tens of thousands of instances remain exposed to the open internet tonight.

The uncomfortable truth: Your modern web framework may be introducing critical vulnerabilities faster than your security team can scan for them.

→ Audit your web applications for vulnerable versions of React Server Components.
→ Implement strict WAF rules to block unusual POST requests targeting server-side components.
→ Conduct an immediate vulnerability scan of all public-facing web infrastructure.

Do you have a real-time inventory of all web applications using React Server Components? 👇

Your browser update cycle is a race against active exploitation. 🌐

CVE-2026-2441 · Severity 8.8 · First actively exploited Chrome zero-day of 2026 targeting CSS components.

We are seeing attackers leverage this use-after-free flaw to execute arbitrary code within the browser sandbox. While @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) has released a fix, unpatched browsers remain a critical risk for initial entry into your network.

Compromise happens as soon as a victim visits a malicious or hijacked website. This vulnerability is currently being utilized in targeted campaigns aimed at corporate credentials and data.

The uncomfortable truth: Your users are one malicious link away from a system compromise if browser updates aren't automated.

→ Force a global update for all Chrome instances to version 145.0.7632.75 or higher.
→ Monitor endpoint logs for unauthorized shell executions originating from browser processes.
→ Enable hardware-enforced stack protection on all supported enterprise workstations.

Have you automated your browser patch deployment to happen within four hours of release? 👇
