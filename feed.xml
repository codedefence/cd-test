      <p>CISA has added a critical Samsung Mobile vulnerability (CVE-2025-21042) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating patching for federal agencies. The flaw was used as a zero-day to deploy the "LANDFALL" spyware, possibly through a zero-click attack vector using malicious DNG images sent via apps like WhatsApp.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a severe threat to mobile security. A zero-click exploit allows attackers to compromise a device and install spyware without any user interaction, enabling total surveillance of high-value targets like executives and government officials, and compromising all corporate data on that device.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write flaw in Samsung's proprietary image processing library. An attacker can send a malformed image that, when processed by the device (even for a preview), triggers the flaw and allows arbitrary code execution.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your IT/MDM teams to push the Samsung April 2025 (or later) security update to all corporate and BYOD Samsung devices immediately. Remind high-risk personnel to disable all media auto-download features in messaging applications as a precaution.</p>

      <p>SAP has released its November 2025 Security Patch Day, addressing 18 new vulnerabilities, including several critical flaws. The most severe is a CVSS 10.0 flaw (CVE-2025-42890) in SQL Anywhere Monitor that allows for a complete system takeover. An update to another 10.0 flaw (CVE-2025-42944) for insecure deserialization in NetWeaver AS Java was also released.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      These vulnerabilities in core SAP systems (ERP, NetWeaver, Solution Manager) are catastrophic. Attackers can gain unauthenticated remote access, execute arbitrary code, and completely compromise the company's "crown jewels," including financial, HR, and supply chain data.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The flaws range from insecure key management and insecure deserialization to code injection, all of which are high-severity issues in complex, internet-facing enterprise applications that grant deep access if exploited.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This is an urgent patching priority. Direct your SAP administrators and security teams to apply these critical patches immediately, focusing first on internet-facing systems like NetWeaver Java portals and SAP Solution Manager.</p>

    <title>Zscaler Report: IoT/OT Attacks on Energy Sector Skyrocket 387%</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/11/zscaler-report-iot-ot-energy-attacks-surge</link>

      <p>The new Zscaler ThreatLabz 2025 report reveals a massive surge in cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure. Attacks on the energy sector's IoT and Operational Technology (OT) systems increased by 387% over the previous year, with manufacturing and healthcare also seeing significant spikes.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This trend confirms that attackers (including nation-states like Volt Typhoon) have shifted their focus to OT and IoT as the new, high-value frontier. A successful attack can disrupt physical operations, causing power outages, halting production lines, and posing a direct threat to public safety.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The convergence of IT and OT networks, combined with the proliferation of unpatched or misconfigured IoT/OT devices, has created a massive, vulnerable attack surface that attackers are now systematically exploiting.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Mandate a full asset inventory of all IoT and OT devices on your network. Enforce strict network segmentation to isolate critical OT systems from the IT network. Prioritize a zero-trust approach for any device connecting to critical operational environments.</p>

    <title>Hyundai/Kia IT Provider Breach Impacts 2.7 Million Vehicle Owners</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/hyundaibreach/800/400" alt="The logos of Hyundai and Kia on a glass building with a digital data breach warning overlay." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Hyundai AutoEver America (HAEA), the IT services provider for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis, has confirmed a massive data breach affecting 2.7 million vehicle owners. The stolen data includes highly sensitive PII, such as names, addresses, and Social Security numbers (SSNs).</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a severe supply chain breach. It exposes millions of customers to high risk of identity theft and targeted fraud. It also severely damages trust in the Hyundai/Kia brands and their connected vehicle ecosystems, likely leading to class-action lawsuits and regulatory fines.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers breached HAEA, a third-party IT provider, to steal data from its parent companies. This classic supply chain attack targets a (presumably) less-secure affiliate to bypass the main corporate defenses and access "crown jewel" customer data.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review your Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) program immediately. Identify all vendors that have access to or store your customers' PII. Ensure contractual obligations for security are in place and that you have visibility into your vendors' security posture.</p>

    <title>The New Frontier: Hijacking AI Agents for Malicious Tasks</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/11/ai-agents-hijacking-hacking-threat</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/aiagent/800/400" alt="A helpful robot icon being manipulated by a shadowy hacker figure, with strings attached like a puppet." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A new and growing threat vector is emerging: the hijacking of autonomous "AI agents." Security experts warn that these agents, designed to perform tasks on a user's behalf (like booking travel or managing calendars), can be commandeered by attackers using prompt injection to perform malicious actions like exfiltrating data or accessing bank accounts.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      As organizations integrate AI agents, a hijacked agent becomes the ultimate insider threat—one with legitimate credentials and access. This attack vector bypasses traditional security, as the agent is *authorized* to perform tasks, but is doing so with malicious intent provided by an attacker.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      This is an evolution of prompt injection. Attackers can "slip in" malicious instructions (e.g., hidden in a webpage or email the agent is processing) that the AI interprets as a new, valid command, turning it against its user.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Treat the adoption of autonomous AI agents with extreme caution. Direct your AI governance team to establish strict security policies, such as requiring explicit user approval for any sensitive actions (e.g., data export, financial transactions) performed by an agent.</p>
