Your SD-WAN fabric is under active attack for root-level control. 🛡️

CVE-2026-20127 · Severity 10.0 · Critical Authentication Bypass in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has issued Emergency Directive 26-03 following confirmed active exploitation of @[Cisco](urn:li:organization:1063) SD-WAN Manager and Controller. This maximum-severity flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to obtain administrative privileges and manipulate entire network fabrics.

Federal agencies have been ordered to inventory all systems by tonight and apply patches by tomorrow afternoon. This is not just a vulnerability; it is a live campaign that dates back to 2023 and has now reached a critical threshold.

The uncomfortable truth: If your SD-WAN management plane is compromised, the attacker essentially owns every packet and policy across your entire wide-area network.

→ Inventory all Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager and Controller instances immediately.
→ Apply Cisco provided updates to address CVE-2026-20127 and CVE-2022-20775 by tomorrow.
→ Conduct a deep hunt for indicators of compromise using the hunt guidance provided in ED 26-03.

Have you verified the integrity of your SD-WAN controller logs for unauthorized administrative logins? 👇

State-sponsored actors used your cloud spreadsheets as a spy tool. 📊

53 Organizations · 42 Countries · China-linked espionage cluster UNC2814 disrupted.

@[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) and @[Mandiant](urn:li:organization:264848) have revealed a prolific campaign that used @[Google Sheets](urn:li:organization:1441) as a covert command-and-control (C2) channel. By hiding malicious traffic within legitimate cloud API requests, attackers evaded detection for nearly a decade while targeting telecoms and governments.

The group deployed a novel backdoor named GridTide, which masqueraded as legitimate system processes. This camouflage allowed them to slip past standard network triggers by blending in with the cloud patterns teams see every day.

The uncomfortable truth: Your greatest blind spot is the legitimate cloud software that your security tools are trained to ignore.

→ Review and restrict API access to cloud productivity suites for non-essential service accounts.
→ Monitor for unusual data transfer patterns to common SaaS platforms like Sheets or Drive.
→ Audit your Linux servers for unauthorized binaries masquerading as package managers like apt.

How does your SOC detect data exfiltration when it is disguised as a legitimate cloud API call? 👇

Attackers found a way to bypass your Windows security prompts entirely. 🔓

CVE-2026-21510 · Severity 8.8 · Active exploitation of Windows Shell and SmartScreen mechanisms.

We are seeing a surge in attacks utilizing this @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) zero-day to bypass SmartScreen and Windows Shell security prompts. By tricking a user into clicking a crafted shortcut file, attackers can execute code without any user warning or consent.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has added this to the KEV catalog as it is currently being used in active ransomware and infostealer campaigns. This flaw represents a fundamental breakdown in the UI-based security boundaries that many employees rely on.

The uncomfortable truth: User training won't save you when the operating system's built-in warnings are successfully suppressed by the attacker.

→ Apply the February 2026 security updates to all Windows endpoints immediately.
→ Implement Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to block the execution of potentially obfuscated scripts.
→ Audit for unusual .LNK and .URL files arriving via email or downloaded from the web.

Are you still relying on user intuition to spot malicious shortcut files? 👇

  <title>Legacy OLE components are the weakest link in your Office suite. 🖇️</title>

Legacy OLE components are the weakest link in your Office suite. 🖇️

CVE-2026-21514 · Severity 7.8 · Active bypass of OLE mitigations in @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) Word.

We are seeing attackers use crafted Word documents to bypass the OLE mitigations designed to protect users from malicious controls. This vulnerability is being actively exploited to achieve code execution when a user opens a compromised Office file.

This flaw is particularly dangerous because it bypasses the protections that users have come to expect in modern @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) 365 environments. While the Preview Pane is not affected, the act of opening a document is enough to initiate the compromise.

The uncomfortable truth: Your modern cloud security stack is only as strong as the legacy protocols it still supports.

→ Patch all Microsoft 365 and Office installations with the latest February updates.
→ Disable the execution of OLE objects via Group Policy for users who do not require it.
→ Audit your email sandbox logs for Word documents attempting to trigger legacy COM controls.

Do you know which departments in your organization still rely on legacy OLE functionality? 👇
