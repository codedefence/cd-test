      <p>At Ignite 2025 today, Microsoft unveiled "Agent 365," a new governance platform designed to manage the explosion of autonomous AI agents in the enterprise. The tool allows IT admins to track, audit, and quarantine unsanctioned "shadow agents" created by employees using third-party frameworks.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      "Shadow AI Agents" have become a critical risk, with employees deploying unmonitored bots that have access to corporate data and perform automated tasks. This platform provides the visibility needed to prevent data leakage and unauthorized actions by rogue AI agents.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The rapid adoption of agentic AI (agents that *do* things, not just chat) has outpaced governance. Employees are connecting unauthorized agents to internal APIs to automate workflows, creating massive blind spots for security teams.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your CIO and CISO to evaluate Agent 365 immediately. Establishing a "control plane" for AI agents is now as critical as managing human identity. You must gain visibility into what agents are running in your environment before they cause a breach.</p>

    <title>Darktrace Warning: North Korean Hackers Using "ClickFix" to Bypass EDR</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/19/darktrace-north-korea-clickfix-tactic</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/clickfixhack/800/400" alt="A fake error popup window asking a user to copy-paste a PowerShell script to 'fix' an issue." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A new threat report released today by Darktrace highlights a surge in "ClickFix" social engineering attacks, particularly by North Korean groups (Lazarus). This tactic involves tricking users (often IT staff or devs) into copying and pasting malicious PowerShell scripts to "fix" a fake error on a website or video conference.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This technique is highly effective because it bypasses standard malware detection. The user is manually executing the malicious command, which EDR tools often interpret as legitimate administrative activity. It grants attackers immediate, stealthy access to endpoints.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers are adapting to improved email defenses by moving attacks to the browser and exploiting the "human gap." The technique leverages the clipboard, which is difficult for security tools to inspect in real-time.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Update security awareness training to specifically cover "ClickFix" and "clipboard injection" attacks. Restrict the ability for standard users to execute PowerShell scripts and consider browser extensions that block pasting of code into the terminal.</p>

    <title>Warlock Ransomware Exploits Security Tool "Velociraptor" (CVE-2025-6264)</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/19/warlock-ransomware-velociraptor-exploit</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/velociraptorhacked/800/400" alt="A digital dinosaur icon (Velociraptor logo) appearing corrupted and malicious on a security dashboard." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The "Warlock" ransomware group has been observed exploiting a vulnerability (CVE-2025-6264) in Velociraptor, a popular digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool. The flaw involves incorrect default permissions, allowing attackers to leverage the tool itself to deploy ransomware across the network.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a cruel irony: attackers are weaponizing the very tool used to hunt them. Velociraptor has high-level privileges on all endpoints for monitoring purposes. Compromising it gives attackers a "god mode" channel to distribute malware instantly to every managed device.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      A misconfiguration in the default deployment of the Velociraptor server allowed unauthorized API access. Warlock operators identified internet-facing instances and used them as a command-and-control (C2) mechanism.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      If your security team uses Velociraptor, mandate an immediate audit of its configuration. Ensure it is updated, not exposed to the public internet, and that API access requires strong authentication. Treat security infrastructure as your highest-value target.</p>

    <title>Qilin Ransomware Becomes Top Threat, Recruiting from Defunct Groups</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/19/qilin-ransomware-top-threat-q3-2025</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 20:10:00 +0300</pubDate>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/qilinransomware/800/400" alt="A graph showing the sharp rise of the Qilin ransomware group, overtaking others." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>New data from Check Point Research and Cyble confirms that "Qilin" has emerged as the most active ransomware group in Q3 2025, averaging 75 victims per month. The group has aggressively recruited affiliates from defunct gangs like RansomHub and is heavily targeting the financial sector.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      The ransomware landscape is consolidating around Qilin, making them a "super-predator." Their highly sophisticated Rust-based ransomware and aggressive double-extortion tactics (specifically targeting high-value financial data) pose the single largest criminal threat to enterprises right now.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Following law enforcement actions against LockBit and the exit of RansomHub, Qilin capitalized on the power vacuum. They offer better profit shares and more stable infrastructure to criminal affiliates, allowing them to scale operations rapidly.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Update your threat models to focus on Qilin's TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). They are known for targeting Linux/ESXi environments and stealing data before encryption. Ensure your backup strategy explicitly covers these virtualized environments.</p>
