      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> After weeks of active exploitation, Cisco has released a patch for a critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-20393, CVSS 10.0) in its Secure Email Gateway (SEG) products. The flaw in the "Spam Quarantine" feature allowed unauthenticated remote attackers to gain root access and take complete control of the appliance.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Critical. These gateways are the primary defense against phishing and malware for many enterprises. An unpatched gateway acts as a "Trojan Horse," allowing attackers to inspect all incoming email traffic and inject malware into legitimate correspondence.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The vulnerability stemmed from insufficient validation of HTTP requests in the Spam Quarantine interface. Attackers had been exploiting this in the wild since late November 2025, weeks before Cisco acknowledged the issue.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> <strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Verify that your IT team has applied the AsyncOS patch released this weekend. If patching is delayed, ensure the "Spam Quarantine" HTTP interface is blocked from the public internet immediately.</p>

    <title>Meta Denies "Breach" After 17.5M Instagram Records Surface on Dark Web</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/18/meta-instagram-data-leak-controversy</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/instagram-denial/800/400" alt="Instagram logo behind a shattered glass effect with binary code leaking out." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Meta has officially denied a system breach following reports that a database of 17.5 million Instagram users is for sale on the dark web. However, they admitted that an "external entity" abused the password reset feature to harass users. Security analysts warn the leaked data (names, emails, phone numbers) is legitimate and likely scraped via API abuse.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High reputational risk and increased phishing exposure. Even if Meta's "core systems" weren't hacked, the result for your employees is the same: their personal contact details are now in the hands of criminals, increasing the risk of "Executive Impersonation" and targeted phishing.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> This incident exploits the "gray area" of API security. Attackers abused legitimate features (password reset) at massive scale to scrape user data, a technique that often bypasses traditional intrusion detection systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Remind high-profile executives to ignore any unrequested "Password Reset" emails from Instagram. Mandate the use of an Authenticator App (not SMS) for 2FA on all corporate-linked social media accounts.</p>

    <title>China-Linked APT "UAT-8837" Targeting Critical Infrastructure via Sitecore</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/18/china-apt-sitecore-exploit-critical-infra</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Cisco Talos has identified a Chinese state-sponsored group (UAT-8837) actively exploiting a critical Sitecore CMS vulnerability (CVE-2025-53690) to breach critical infrastructure organizations. Once inside, the group disables RDP security features and deploys "EarthWorm" to tunnel traffic out of the secure network.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This highlights the risk of "Web-to-OT" pivoting. Attackers are using vulnerable public-facing websites (running Sitecore) as a stepping stone to reach internal Operational Technology (OT) networks that control physical machinery and utilities.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Many organizations patch their OS and firewalls but neglect the Content Management System (CMS) layer. Sitecore is widely used in enterprise environments, making it a high-yield target for APTs looking for a foothold.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Audit your external web footprint for Sitecore instances. If found, verify they are patched against CVE-2025-53690. Ensure your web servers are in a DMZ and cannot directly initiate connections to your internal OT/production network.</p>

    <title>GitLab "Pipeline Poisoning" Alert: Critical Flaws Affect CI/CD Workflows</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/18/gitlab-critical-pipeline-vulnerabilities</link>
    <pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/gitlab-pipeline/800/400" alt="A software development pipeline with a red 'Toxic' warning symbol injecting malicious code." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> GitLab has released urgent updates to fix multiple critical vulnerabilities (including CVE-2025-3950) that allow for Authentication Bypass and Remote Code Execution via CI/CD pipelines. Attackers can exploit these to inject malicious code into software builds or steal secrets stored in the pipeline environment.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High "Supply Chain" risk. If your software team uses self-hosted GitLab, an attacker could silently insert a backdoor into your company's product updates, affecting all your customers downstream (similar to the SolarWinds attack).</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Flaws in the SAML authentication logic (via `ruby-saml`) allowed attackers to impersonate legitimate users and trigger malicious pipeline jobs.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Enforce an immediate upgrade to GitLab versions 17.8.4, 17.7.6, or 17.6.5. Rotate all CI/CD tokens and secrets (AWS keys, API tokens) stored in GitLab, as they should be considered compromised if the instance was unpatched.</p>
