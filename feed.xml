Your webmail is a silent doorway for state-sponsored espionage. 📧

CVE-2025-49113 · Severity 9.9 · Critical Remote Code Execution in Roundcube Webmail.

We are seeing attackers leverage this deserialization flaw to take full control of affected systems. This vulnerability was added to the @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) KEV catalog in the last 24 hours due to active exploitation by advanced threat groups.

Attackers are targeting unpatched webmail servers to steal login credentials and spy on sensitive communications. With over 53 million hosts potentially impacted, the window for remediation is closing rapidly.

The uncomfortable truth: Your webmail is the most direct path for an attacker to compromise your corporate identity and internal communications.

→ Patch Roundcube Webmail to version 1.6.11 or 1.5.10 LTS immediately.
→ Audit your mail server logs for unauthorized PHP object deserialization attempts.
→ Force a password reset for all users if your server was exposed and unpatched.

Have you confirmed that your webmail infrastructure is running the latest security patches? 👇

If attackers own your remote access, they own your entire network. 🔓

CVE-2026-1731 · Severity 9.9 · Critical unauthenticated RCE in Remote Support and PRA.

We are seeing a massive surge in exploitation attempts against @[BeyondTrust](urn:li:organization:12625) instances. The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has issued an urgent deadline for federal agencies to remediate this flaw within three days.

Attackers are currently deploying web shells and backdoors to achieve persistent access. This vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary commands with full administrative privileges without a valid login.

The uncomfortable truth: The software you use to secure your environment is becoming the highest-risk point of failure for your enterprise.

→ Patch all self-hosted Remote Support and PRA appliances to version BT26-02 immediately.
→ Restrict appliance web management access to known IP ranges or a secure VPN only.
→ Conduct a retrospective forensic search for unauthorized admin account creation.

Is your remote access infrastructure currently internet-exposed without secondary IP restrictions? 👇

Attackers just bypassed your Windows security prompts entirely. 🛡️

CVE-2026-21510 · Severity 8.8 · Active exploitation of Windows Shell and SmartScreen security.

We are seeing attackers distribute malicious shortcut files that bypass SmartScreen warnings to execute code silently. This vulnerability allows for the suppression of are-you-sure dialogs for untrusted content on @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) systems.

This flaw is being used to deliver further payloads without raising user suspicion. It highlights a critical failure in the UI-based security boundaries that many organizations still rely on.

The uncomfortable truth: User training won't save your network when the operating system fails to provide a warning for malicious content.

→ Apply the February 2026 security updates to all Windows endpoints immediately.
→ Block the download or execution of .LNK and .URL files from external sources at the gateway.
→ Enable Attack Surface Reduction rules to prevent shortcuts from launching untrusted code.

Are you still relying on user intuition to spot malicious shortcut and link files? 👇

Your browser update cycle is a race against active exploitation. 🌐

CVE-2026-2441 · Severity 8.8 · First actively exploited Chrome zero-day of 2026 targeting CSS components.

We are seeing attackers leverage this use-after-free flaw to execute arbitrary code within the browser sandbox. While @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) has released a fix, unpatched browsers remain a critical risk for initial entry into your network.

Compromise happens as soon as a victim visits a malicious or hijacked website. This vulnerability is currently being utilized in targeted campaigns aimed at corporate credentials and data.

The uncomfortable truth: Your users are one malicious link away from a system compromise if browser updates aren't automated.

→ Force a global update for all Chrome instances to version 145.0.7632.75 or higher.
→ Monitor endpoint logs for unauthorized shell executions originating from browser processes.
→ Enable hardware-enforced stack protection on all supported enterprise workstations.

Have you automated your browser patch deployment to happen within four hours of release? 👇
