      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CISA has added a critical Path Traversal vulnerability in Gogs (CVE-2025-8110) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. This flaw in the self-hosted Git service allows attackers to access sensitive files on the host system, potentially leading to credential theft and full server takeover.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High. Many organizations use self-hosted Git instances to avoid public cloud exposure. This breach allows an attacker to steal proprietary source code and intellectual property, which is catastrophic for software development firms.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Inadequate input sanitization within the Gogs file-handling logic allowed crafted paths to escape the restricted repository directory.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Mandate an immediate patch for all self-hosted Gogs instances to the latest version. Conduct a forensic audit to ensure no unauthorized file access occurred during the exploitation window.</p>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> SAP has released its first security notes of 2026, headlined by a critical SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2026-0501, CVSS 9.9) in SAP S/4HANA Financials – General Ledger. An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially gaining full control over financial records and the underlying system.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Extreme. The General Ledger is the financial core of the enterprise. Compromise here could lead to undetected financial fraud, data manipulation, and total loss of integrity in financial reporting—posing a significant risk for publicly traded companies.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The flaw involves an RFC-enabled function module that uses ABAP Database Connectivity (ADBC) without proper input validation, allowing native SQL statements to be injected.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Prioritize SAP Security Note #3687749 for immediate deployment. Audit all financial transactions and general ledger logs from the past 48 hours to ensure no unauthorized tampering occurred.</p>

    <title>India Proposes Mandatory Source Code Sharing for Smartphone Manufacturers</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/13/india-source-code-mandate-smartphone-security</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/smartphone-code/800/400" alt="A smartphone silhouette with glowing source code lines and the Indian national emblem." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In a major regulatory shift, the Indian government is proposing a mandate requiring smartphone manufacturers to share their operating system source code for security auditing. The move aims to strengthen national security and identify potential "backdoors" or hidden data exfiltration modules.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Moderate for domestic security, but high for international vendors (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi). This could lead to trade friction and intellectual property concerns, but it sets a new global benchmark for sovereign control over digital infrastructure.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Growing geopolitical tensions and concerns over data sovereignty have prompted the government to seek greater visibility into the software stacks powering the nation's primary communication devices.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> For multinational vendors, begin preparing a "Sovereign Audit Package" that provides necessary transparency without compromising core proprietary algorithms. Consult with local legal teams on the upcoming data protection compliance frameworks.</p>

    <title>Apple Patches Actively Exploited iOS Zero-Day Vulnerabilities</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/13/apple-ios-zero-day-patch-alert</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/iphone-security/800/400" alt="An iPhone screen with a red 'System Update' icon and a shield protecting it from binary particles." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Apple has released an emergency security update to fix critical zero-day vulnerabilities in iOS that were being used in highly targeted attacks. The flaws could allow an attacker to bypass security protections and execute code with kernel-level privileges.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High risk for high-net-worth individuals and executives. Targeted spyware often utilizes these kernel-level flaws to gain total control over communications, cameras, and location data without the user's knowledge.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Sophisticated threat actors continue to invest in finding complex logic flaws in the iOS kernel to facilitate long-term surveillance operations.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Mandate an immediate update to iOS for all work-managed devices. Advise senior leadership to reboot their devices weekly, as this can disrupt the persistence of some memory-only mobile malware.</p>
