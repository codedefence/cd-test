      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has accelerated its antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, issuing civil investigative demands to rivals and customers. The probe heavily targets Microsoft’s practice of bundling artificial intelligence (Copilot), identity management (Entra), and cybersecurity software directly into its dominant Windows and Office platforms.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Strategic Market Shift. If the FTC forces an "unbundling," enterprise clients will face a fragmented procurement landscape. However, it also opens the door for independent cybersecurity vendors to compete on a level playing field without being squeezed out by default Microsoft inclusions.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Regulators are increasingly concerned that integrating security and AI directly into the OS creates a monolithic attack surface—as evidenced by recent high-profile breaches—while stifling fair market competition.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Review your organization's dependency on the Microsoft "E5" security stack. Begin evaluating independent "Best-of-Breed" alternatives for identity and endpoint protection to ensure resilience against potential future forced unbundling.</p>

    <title>Critical RCE (CVE-2025-64712) in Unstructured.io Threatens Enterprise AI Pipelines</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been disclosed in Unstructured.io, an open-source ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) library utilized by 87% of Fortune 1000 companies to ingest data for Large Language Models (LLMs). The flaw allows attackers to compromise the underlying servers processing training data.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Severe Supply Chain Risk for AI. This vulnerability sits at the very start of the AI data pipeline. Exploiting it allows attackers to silently poison corporate AI models or establish a backdoor directly into high-compute cloud environments before the data even reaches the LLM.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Improper parsing and sanitization of complex unstructured file types (like deeply nested PDFs or corrupted Office docs) allowed malicious payloads to execute during the data extraction phase.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Isolate all AI data-ingestion servers from the broader production network immediately. Force an update of the Unstructured.io library to the patched release and audit your MLOps pipelines for unauthorized file execution.</p>

    <title>AI-Driven "Digital Arrest" Scams Surge 33%, Netting Extortionists Millions</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Financial cybercrime units report a massive 33% year-over-year surge in "Digital Arrest" extortion scams. Using plug-and-play Generative AI tools, fraudsters are now launching highly personalized, automated vishing (voice phishing) and video deepfake campaigns. Scammers impersonate law enforcement, convincing victims they are under secret digital arrest until they transfer funds.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Risk to Executive Safety. The democratization of AI means criminals no longer need large "boiler room" call centers to execute complex social engineering. High-net-worth individuals and corporate executives are prime targets for these deeply convincing, rapid-fire extortion attempts.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Readily available AI models can now rapidly sift through public OSINT data (social media, employment records) to tailor a highly convincing, personalized script, while real-time voice cloning bypasses human skepticism.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Integrate "Deepfake and Vishing Awareness" into your executive protection programs. Establish a firm "Challenge Protocol" (a pre-agreed safe word or out-of-band verification method) for any urgent financial or legal requests made over voice or video.</p>

    <title>Delhi Mandates Sweeping Cyber Rules to Protect Unified "Golden Records"</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/14/delhi-golden-records-cyber-security-mandate</link>
    <pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 15:15:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/14/delhi-golden-records-cyber-security-mandate</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/delhi-cyber/800/400" alt="A digital vault glowing with golden data streams, protected by a heavy cyber shield." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Delhi government has issued strict new cybersecurity guidelines to protect its transition toward a unified data hub designed to generate "golden records" of its citizens. The mandates include the immediate appointment of Assistant Chief Information Security Officers (ACISOs), enforced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and a total ban on the use of third-party email platforms for official work.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Evolving Public Sector Standards. As governments centralize massive citizen databases, they become highly attractive targets for nation-state APTs. For IT and security vendors, this creates a rigid new compliance baseline required to win or maintain public sector contracts.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The consolidation of disparate departmental data (revenue, utilities, health) into a single "golden record" drastically amplifies the blast radius of a potential breach, necessitating a zero-tolerance approach to legacy IT practices.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> If your consultancy handles government contracts, ensure your internal infrastructure maps directly to these new mandates. Audit your teams to guarantee zero use of "Shadow IT" or third-party email when communicating with public sector clients.</p>
