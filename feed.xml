    <title>Critical VMware vCenter RCE (CVE-2025-7722) Exploited in Wild</title>

      <p>Broadcom (VMware) has released an emergency patch for a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2025-7722, CVSS 9.8) in vCenter Server. The flaw, located in the DCE/RPC protocol implementation, allows unauthenticated attackers to send a specially crafted network packet to execute arbitrary code and take full control of the virtualized environment.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      vCenter is the "crown jewel" of the data center. Compromise here gives attackers unrestricted command over all virtual machines, storage, and networking. Attackers are actively scanning for exposed vCenter servers to deploy ransomware encryptors directly to the hypervisor level.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the way vCenter handles certain RPC requests. Despite previous warnings to isolate management interfaces, thousands of vCenter servers remain exposed to the public internet, making them easy targets.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This is a "drop everything" priority. Patch vCenter immediately. If patching is not possible within the hour, verify that the vCenter management interface is completely blocked from the internet and restricted to a secure management VPN.</p>

    <title>"Play" Ransomware Gang Adopts React2Shell Exploit for Mass Attacks</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/10/play-ransomware-react2shell-campaign</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/play-ransomware-react/800/400" alt="A web application interface glitching into the 'Play' ransomware logo." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The "Play" ransomware group has integrated the critical "React2Shell" vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) into its automated attack toolkit. Security firms report a spike in Play ransomware infections targeting organizations running unpatched Next.js and React applications, moving from initial access to full encryption in under 4 hours.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This marks the shift of React2Shell from a targeted espionage tool to a mass-crime weapon. Organizations that delayed patching their web frontends are now facing immediate operational shutdown and extortion demands. The speed of the attack leaves little time for manual intervention.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Criminal groups adopt effective exploits rapidly. The public availability of Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code for React2Shell allowed Play's developers to weaponize it quickly, targeting the widespread attack surface of modern web apps.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      If you haven't patched React/Next.js yet, assume your web servers are compromised. Isolate them from the core network immediately and initiate incident response procedures to check for web shells or lateral movement.</p>

    <title>Black Basta Leaks Sensitive Data from London Councils</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/10/london-councils-data-leak-black-basta</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/london-data-leak/800/400" alt="A view of the London skyline with sensitive documents floating in the air, symbolizing a data leak." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Following the refusal of London councils to pay the ransom, the Black Basta gang has published 500GB of sensitive data on the dark web. The leak includes scanned passports, council tax records, and social care case files for thousands of residents in Kensington, Chelsea, and Westminster.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is the "worst-case scenario" realized. The exposure of highly sensitive vulnerable resident data creates severe safeguarding risks and opens the councils to massive GDPR fines and class-action lawsuits. Trust in local government digital services has been severely damaged.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The UK government maintains a strict policy against paying ransoms. While this discourages future attacks, the immediate consequence is the weaponization of stolen data. Black Basta followed through on their threat to punish the victim for non-payment.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Public sector leaders must prepare crisis communication strategies for data leaks. Ensure that "identity protection" monitoring services are pre-contracted and ready to deploy to citizens immediately upon a confirmed leak.</p>

    <title>New "Model Denial of Service" Attacks Costing Companies Millions</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/ai-dos-attack/800/400" alt="An AI server overheating and smoking due to a massive influx of complex queries." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A new trend of "Model Denial of Service" (MDoS) attacks is targeting companies with public-facing LLM APIs. Attackers are sending specially crafted, computationally expensive prompts (like complex recursive logic puzzles) that force the AI model to consume massive amounts of GPU resources, driving up cloud bills and causing service outages.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is "financial DDoS." Instead of crashing a server with traffic volume, attackers are exhausting the *budget* and *compute capacity* of the target. One startup reported a $200,000 cloud bill spike in 24 hours due to a sustained MDoS attack.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Standard rate limiting (requests per minute) fails to stop MDoS because a single complex prompt counts as one request but can tie up a GPU for minutes. Attackers are exploiting the gap between API metering and actual compute cost.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Update your AI API rate limits to measure "token complexity" or compute time, not just request count. Implement "early exit" mechanisms to terminate processing for prompts that exceed a certain computational threshold.</p>
