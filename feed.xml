      <p>Pro-Russian hacktivist groups have claimed responsibility for a massive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that knocked the French national postal service, La Poste, offline today. The timing is clearly intended to maximize disruption during the peak holiday delivery window.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      For logistics and retail firms, this is a nightmare scenario. The outage stops parcel tracking and digital postal services at the busiest time of the year. It highlights how hacktivists use "pressure points" like holidays to amplify the psychological and economic impact of their attacks.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The attack is likely a retaliatory measure for recent French diplomatic or military support to Ukraine. Hacktivists utilize vast botnets to overwhelm public-facing web servers, demonstrating that even state-run infrastructure can be vulnerable to high-volume volumetric attacks.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Logistics companies should verify their DDoS mitigation services (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) are in 'High Alert' mode. Ensure that customer service portals have fallback communication channels ready for when primary websites go down.</p>

    <title>Crypto Heists Hit $2.7 Billion in 2025 as North Korea Smashes Records</title>

      <p>New data from blockchain intelligence firms confirms that 2025 has been a record year for cryptocurrency theft, with over $2.7 billion stolen. North Korea's Lazarus Group alone is responsible for approximately $2 billion of this total, a 51% increase year-over-year, to fund sanctioned weapons programs.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      The scale of these heists threatens the stability of the digital asset ecosystem. For businesses in Bahrain and elsewhere looking to integrate Web3, it highlights that nation-state actors are the primary threat. Private key compromise remains the #1 vulnerability, often achieved through highly targeted social engineering of employees.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Lazarus Group has "professionalized" its tactics, posing as recruiters on LinkedIn to send malware-laden job descriptions to developers. They have shifted focus from DeFi protocols to centralized exchanges and cross-chain bridges where larger pools of liquidity reside.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Implement "Hardened Enclaves" and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for all high-value digital asset management. Run mandatory social engineering simulations specifically targeting your finance and development teams who have access to sensitive keys.</p>

    <title>CISA Deadline Today for Critical Cisco Zero-Day (CVE-2025-20393)</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/24/cisa-deadline-cisco-zero-day-rebuild</link>

      <p>Today, December 24, is the CISA-mandated deadline for federal agencies to remediate the critical unpatched Cisco zero-day (CVE-2025-20393). As no patch exists, Cisco Talos has reiterated that "rebuilding from scratch" is the only way to ensure the <strong>AquaShell</strong> backdoor is removed from compromised appliances.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a high-friction remediation. Rebuilding hardware during the holiday break is a massive drain on resources but essential. Any organization—public or private—running Cisco Secure Email with an internet-facing 'Spam Quarantine' is at high risk of active espionage by Chinese-nexus group UAT-9686.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability persists because it targets a specific configuration that Cisco had not originally recommended for internet exposure. The lack of a patch means the vendor is struggling with a complex architectural fix for AsyncOS.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      If your consultancy clients in Bahrain haven't verified their Cisco configurations yet, this must be the final "Clear to Close" task of the day. If compromise is suspected, the appliance must be taken offline and rebuilt with clean firmware immediately.</p>

    <title>ServiceNow Bets $7.75 Billion on Armis to Solve IoT Blind Spots</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/24/servicenow-buys-armis-7-billion</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/servicenow-armis/800/400" alt="Two high-tech puzzle pieces connecting, one with the ServiceNow logo and one with Armis, glowing with data lines." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>In the largest cybersecurity deal of the year, ServiceNow has agreed to acquire startup Armis for $7.75 billion. The acquisition aims to integrate Armis's real-time asset discovery and AI threat detection directly into the ServiceNow platform to manage the explosion of unmanaged IoT devices.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This deal signals that "Visibility" is the new priority for 2026. Companies cannot protect what they cannot see. By merging asset management with security detection, ServiceNow aims to provide a single "source of truth" for everything from corporate laptops to factory floor sensors and hospital infusion pumps.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Hackers have successfully paralyzed giants like Microsoft and UnitedHealth by targeting unmanaged and unpatchable IoT devices. ServiceNow realizes that traditional IT management must evolve into a unified security and risk posture to survive 2026 threats.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      If you are a ServiceNow user, prepare to leverage these new visibility tools in late 2026. In the meantime, audit your own "Shadow IoT" footprint. Many breaches start on a device that isn't even in the company's official hardware inventory.</p>
