    <title>DeepSeek-V3 "Poisoned Weights" Alert: Malicious Distillations Infecting DevOps Tools</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Security researchers have discovered that several popular "distilled" versions of the DeepSeek-V3 coding model, hosted on public repositories, contain "sleeper" backdoors. These poisoned models, widely used in VS Code extensions and CI/CD autopilots, are programmed to inject subtle security vulnerabilities (like SQLi or hardcoded secrets) into the code they generate for developers.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Supply Chain Risk. If your development team uses open-source coding assistants to save costs, they may be unwittingly introducing vulnerabilities into your production codebase. This effectively weaponizes the "Shadow AI" adoption in engineering teams.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Attackers realized that poisoning the massive DeepSeek base model is impossible, so they targeted the smaller, "optimized" versions that developers actually download and run locally on their laptops.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Issue an immediate "AI Model Whitelist." Block the download of unverified `.gguf` or `.safetensors` files from Hugging Face on corporate networks. Mandate that all coding assistants must use centrally API-gated models rather than local weights.</p>

    <title>Bahrain CBB Issues "AI Liability" Framework for Financial Institutions</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/20/bahrain-cbb-ai-liability-framework</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/bahrain-cbb-ai/800/400" alt="The Bahrain skyline with a digital scale weighing a robot hand against a human hand, representing AI liability." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has released a new directive today holding financial institutions "strictly liable" for financial losses caused by their AI agents. The framework mandates that any autonomous decision made by an AI (e.g., loan denial, fraud flag, auto-trade) must be explainable within 24 hours, or the bank faces automatic penalties.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This changes the risk calculus for deploying "Agentic AI" in Bahraini fintech. The "Black Box" defense (claiming the AI's decision was opaque) is no longer a valid legal shield. It will force a return to simpler, deterministic models for critical financial decisions.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Following the Jan 7th suspension of voice biometrics, the CBB is aggressively regulating the "Algo-Risk" sector to maintain trust in the Kingdom's financial hub status amidst the global AI turbulence.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Review all "Auto-Decisioning" systems in your client portfolio. Ensure every AI output has a logged "Chain of Thought" or audit trail that satisfies the CBB's new explainability requirement.</p>

    <title>Microsoft "Recall" Exploit: Tool Released to Decrypt History Remotely</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/20/microsoft-recall-remote-decryption-exploit</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A hacking group has released "TotalRecall," a tool that exploits a flaw in Microsoft’s "Recall" feature (which takes constant screenshots of user activity). The tool bypasses Windows Hello authentication to remotely decrypt and exfiltrate the local Recall database, effectively turning the feature into native spyware.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Critical Privacy Risk. If compromised, an attacker gains a photographic history of every email, document, and private message viewed by the employee—even those in encrypted apps like Signal. This destroys the confidentiality of "End-to-End Encrypted" communications on the endpoint.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Despite assurances of local encryption, the decryption keys were found to be loaded into memory in a way that could be dumped by a user-level process with elevated privileges.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> <strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Use Group Policy (GPO) to globally disable Windows Recall on all corporate endpoints. Do not rely on user discretion. Verify that the `WindowsAI` service is stopped across the fleet.</p>

    <title>Jenkins "ArtifactJack" Attack: CI/CD Pipelines Hijacked via Plugin Flaw</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/20/jenkins-artifactjack-plugin-vulnerability</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/jenkins-pipeline/800/400" alt="A Jenkins butler logo holding a tray of corrupted files with a red skull icon." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A critical vulnerability (CVE-2026-1022) in a widely used Jenkins artifact management plugin is being exploited to replace legitimate software builds with malware-laden versions. The attack, dubbed "ArtifactJack," occurs post-build but pre-deployment, making it invisible to source code scanners.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Supply Chain Compromise. This allows attackers to distribute malware to your customers *signed with your own valid digital certificate*. It is the digital equivalent of poisoning food after it leaves the kitchen but before it reaches the table.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The plugin failed to validate the integrity of artifacts moving between the build agent and the master node, allowing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) swap within the internal network.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Implement "Binary Signing" immediately *at the build stage*, not the release stage. Ensure that your deployment scripts verify the hash of the artifact against the original build hash before pushing to production.</p>
