Your remote access tools are being used to dismantle your network. 🔓

CVE-2026-1731 · Severity 9.9 · Critical unauthenticated RCE in Remote Support and PRA.

We are seeing a major escalation in the exploitation of @[BeyondTrust](urn:li:organization:12625) instances. Attackers are currently bypassing authentication to deploy VShell backdoors and SparkRAT for persistent control. The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has confirmed these flaws are being used for reconnaissance, lateral movement, and data theft.

This campaign has already impacted sectors in the U.S., France, and Germany. Because these tools often hold the highest privileges in your network, a compromise here allows an attacker to bypass traditional identity controls entirely.

The uncomfortable truth: If you are running an unpatched management portal exposed to the internet, it is no longer a question of if you will be breached, but how long they have already been inside.

→ Patch all self-hosted Remote Support and PRA appliances to version BT26-02 immediately.
→ Restrict appliance portal access to internal VPN or verified IP allowlists only.
→ Audit your main admin accounts for any unauthorized 60-second hijacks or new profile creations.

Have you confirmed that your remote support portals are hidden from public automated scanners? 👇

State-sponsored actors have established a permanent home in your backups. 🛡️

CVE-2026-22769 · Severity 10.0 · Hardcoded credentials in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has issued an emergency 3-day patch order for this maximum-severity flaw. Evidence shows that China-nexus espionage groups have been exploiting this since mid-2024 to move laterally across virtualized environments.

Attackers are using "Ghost NICs" to quietly pivot through compromised networks without triggering standard EDR alarms. This vulnerability in @[Dell Technologies](urn:li:organization:1193) infrastructure allows for unauthorized access to the core of your disaster recovery stack.

The uncomfortable truth: Your disaster recovery environment is often the least monitored and most vulnerable part of your infrastructure.

→ Patch @[Dell Technologies](urn:li:organization:1193) RecoverPoint for VMs to version 6.0.3.1 HF1 or later today.
→ Rotate all administrative passwords for your virtualization management layer.
→ Search for the presence of the Brickstorm or Grimbolt malware families within your VM clusters.

When was the last time you performed a forensic audit of your disaster recovery site? 👇

Your webmail is currently the lowest-resistance path for data theft. 📧

CVE-2025-49113 · Severity 9.9 · Critical deserialization vulnerability in Roundcube Webmail.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has added this to the KEV catalog as global exploitation spikes. This flaw allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code simply by sending a malicious request to an unpatched mail server.

We are seeing automated scripts harvesting credentials and exfiltrating private communications at scale. Because webmail is usually public-facing, it serves as the perfect initial entry point for broader network compromise.

The uncomfortable truth: If your webmail is unpatched, you should assume that your internal executive communications are no longer private.

→ Update Roundcube Webmail to the latest security release (1.6.11+) immediately.
→ Audit mail server logs for unauthorized PHP object deserialization attempts.
→ Review your DMZ architecture to ensure mail servers are properly segmented from internal assets.

Is your webmail interface still exposed to the internet without a Web Application Firewall? 👇

Your browser update policy is a race against active zero-day kits. 🌐

CVE-2026-2441 · Severity 8.8 · Active zero-day exploitation of Chromium CSS components.

We are seeing a "double-patch" cycle where attackers are pivoting to this zero-day faster than enterprises can deploy the previous week's updates. This memory corruption flaw allows remote code execution via specifically crafted web pages on @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) Chrome and @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) Edge.

Exploit kits are already being utilized to deploy infostealers and achieve initial access. Because this vulnerability is tied to core CSS rendering, it cannot be "disabled" without breaking the web.

The uncomfortable truth: Your users are one malicious click away from compromise, and reporting on the risk is not the same as neutralizing it.

→ Force a global update for all Chromium browsers to version 145.0.7632.75 or higher.
→ Enable hardware-enforced stack protection on all compatible enterprise workstations.
→ Monitor for unusual outbound traffic originating from browser processes to unknown domains.

Does your browser security stack actually block these exploits, or just report them after the fact? 👇
