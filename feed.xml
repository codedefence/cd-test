      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> High Representative Kaja Kallas and Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh have officially signed the India-EU Security and Defense Partnership today in New Delhi. The pact establishes a real-time "Cyber Threat Intelligence" sharing corridor between CERT-In and ENISA, specifically focusing on countering state-sponsored APTs and securing maritime digital infrastructure.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High strategic value. For businesses operating in the India-Europe corridor, this reduces the "fog of war" during major cyber incidents. It creates a unified compliance expectation for critical infrastructure providers in both regions, likely influencing future data sovereignty laws in the GCC as a "bridge" region.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Increasing cyber-aggression from common geopolitical adversaries necessitated a formal alliance. This move aligns India's "Atmanirbhar" defense strategy with Europe's "Digital Sovereignty" goals.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Review your cross-border data transfer policies. Expect new "Trusted Corridor" certifications to emerge that may simplify GDPR-DPDP compliance for entities covered by this defense pact.</p>

    <title>CISA Emergency Directive 26-02: Disconnect All "End-of-Support" F5 Devices</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CISA has issued Emergency Directive 26-02, mandating all federal agencies to physically disconnect F5 BIG-IP devices that have reached "End of Support" (EoS) within 48 hours. Intelligence indicates threat actors are successfully reverse-engineering recent patches to find 1-day exploits in legacy hardware that can no longer be updated.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Critical Infrastructure Risk. Many organizations "sweat assets" (keep old hardware running) to save costs. This directive confirms that EoS hardware is now a confirmed liability. If you are running legacy load balancers, you are effectively operating without a firewall.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> A spike in "Volt Typhoon" activity targeting legacy edge devices was detected, using them as reliable entry points that security teams often ignore because "they just work."</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Conduct an immediate "Hardware Lifecycle Audit." If you have F5 devices older than 5 years (iSeries/Legacy VE), confirm their support status today. If EoS, schedule a replacement or move the workload to a cloud-native load balancer immediately.</p>

    <title>Deloitte Report: 79% of Enterprises Exposed to "Agentic" AI Backdoors</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/27/deloitte-ai-agent-security-report</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A new report by Deloitte's AI Institute reveals a dangerous gap: while 74% of companies plan to deploy autonomous AI agents by late 2026, only 21% have "robust guardrails" to prevent them from acting maliciously. The report cites "Prompt Injection" against agents as the #1 emerging threat, turning helpful assistants into "High-Privilege Backdoors."</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> "Shadow AI" has evolved into "Shadow Agents." Employees are authorizing AI tools to "act on their behalf" (read email, book travel, commit code). Without governance, an attacker only needs to trick the *agent* to bypass all human authentication layers.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The rush to adopt "Agentic Workflows" for productivity has outpaced the development of "Identity Security" for non-human entities.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Update your IAM (Identity & Access Management) policy to create a specific category for "Non-Human Identities" (NHIs). Ensure AI agents are granted "Least Privilege"—they should not have broad read/write access to the CEO's inbox.</p>

    <title>NIST "Q-Day" Roadmap: Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography Now Critical</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/27/nist-post-quantum-migration-roadmap</link>
    <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/27/nist-post-quantum-migration-roadmap</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/quantum-roadmap/800/400" alt="A timeline graphic showing 2026 as the 'Migration Year' with quantum qubits floating in background." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Following the finalization of FIPS 203/204/205 standards, NIST has issued a formal recommendation that organizations must begin "Active Migration" to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in 2026. The agency warns that "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) attacks are already targeting long-shelf-life data (like trade secrets and healthcare records).</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Compliance urgency. Government contracts (especially US/EU) will soon mandate PQC compliance. For financial institutions, upgrading the "Root of Trust" (HSMs and certificates) is a multi-year project that must start this quarter to avoid obsolescence.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Advances in error-correction for quantum computers have accelerated the timeline for potential RSA encryption breaking, moving the threat from "theoretical" to "inevitable."</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Inventory your "Long-Term Data" (data retained for 7+ years). Prioritize switching the encryption keys for this specific data to the new ML-KEM (Kyber) standard first.</p>
