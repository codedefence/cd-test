      <p>Security researchers are warning of active exploitation of a suspected zero-day vulnerability in Fortinet's FortiWeb Web Application Firewall (WAF). Unauthenticated, remote attackers are exploiting the flaw to create unauthorized administrator accounts on vulnerable, internet-facing devices.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a critical breach. A WAF is a key security control that inspects all traffic to your web applications. An attacker who controls the WAF can bypass all its protections, steal sensitive data (like credit cards or PII), modify web traffic, and gain a foothold to attack backend servers.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The flaw (which is not yet assigned a CVE) appears to be an authentication bypass in the WAF's management interface, allowing attackers to use the REST API to create new admin users with full privileges without needing to log in.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your network security team to immediately restrict all access to the FortiWeb management interface to a secure, internal-only network. Mandate an immediate audit of all FortiWeb devices for any new or unrecognized administrator accounts, and prepare to apply patches as soon as Fortinet releases them.</p>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/akira/800/400" alt="The CISA and FBI logos side-by-side with a bold 'IMMINENT THREAT' warning text." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>CISA and the FBI have re-issued a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (#StopRansomware) on the "Akira" ransomware group, warning of an imminent threat to critical infrastructure. The update includes new Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) observed in recent, successful attacks.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This high-level alert signals that Akira is actively deploying new attack methods that are bypassing existing defenses. Organizations in education, finance, and healthcare are primary targets. An attack can lead to full operational shutdown, data exfiltration, and massive recovery costs.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Akira has evolved, now heavily exploiting unpatched Cisco VPNs (without MFA) and the "Citrix Bleed" vulnerability (CVE-2023-4966) for initial access. They have also been seen using tools like "SilentButDeadly" to neutralize EDR security controls.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your SOC and IT teams to immediately ingest the new IoCs and TTPs from this advisory into all security tools (EDR, SIEM). Mandate an immediate patch audit for all Cisco and Citrix edge devices. Enforce phishing-resistant MFA across the entire organization.</p>

    <title>New "SilentButDeadly" Tool Neutralizes EDR/AV Security Software</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/16/silentbutdeadly-edr-av-blocker-tool</link>

      <p>A new open-source offensive security tool named "SilentButDeadly" has been released, designed to neutralize Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Antivirus (AV) software. The tool works by severing the network connections of EDR/AV processes, effectively blinding them from communicating with their cloud management consoles.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This tool is a significant threat to modern security stacks. An attacker who successfully runs it can operate undetected on a compromised endpoint, as the EDR will be unable to send alerts or receive investigation commands, giving the attacker free rein to conduct lateral movement and data exfiltration.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The tool exploits a design element where EDR agents, once disconnected from their cloud, may fail "open" or be unable to report malicious activity. Ransomware groups like Akira are already reportedly incorporating this technique into their attacks.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your endpoint security team to verify with your EDR vendor that they have protections against this type of network isolation attack (e.g., self-protection, fail-closed mechanisms). Ensure detection rules are in place to monitor for processes that attempt to tamper with EDR network connections.</p>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/icsalert/800/400" alt="A factory control panel screen (HMI) with a critical vulnerability warning, showing industrial pipes in the background." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>CISA has published 18 new advisories for Industrial Control Systems (ICS), detailing vulnerabilities in products from major vendors including Siemens, Rockwell Automation, and Mitsubishi Electric. The flaws include issues like improper authentication, command injection, and denial of service.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      These vulnerabilities pose a direct risk to critical manufacturing, energy, and water sectors. Exploitation could allow an attacker to disrupt physical processes, halt production lines, or cause unsafe operating conditions, leading to significant financial losses and public safety risks.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by security researchers, highlighting the ongoing security weaknesses in legacy and modern OT equipment that was not designed to be connected to hostile networks.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your Head of Operations and OT security teams to immediately review this list of 18 advisories. They must identify which assets are in use and prioritize a patch management and mitigation plan, starting with the most critical and exposed systems.</p>

    <title>Healthcare Council Previews 2026 AI Cybersecurity Guidance</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/16/healthcare-ai-cybersecurity-guidance-2026</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/aihealthcare/800/400" alt="A doctor reviewing a patient's X-ray on a tablet, with an AI interface and a secure shield icon." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The Healthcare Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) is previewing its 2026 AI cybersecurity guidance, which outlines best practices for healthcare organizations. The guidance focuses on securing AI-powered diagnostic tools, protecting patient data used in AI models, and managing AI supply chain risks.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This new guidance will establish a much-needed security baseline for the rapid adoption of AI in healthcare. It provides a framework for healthcare providers to innovate responsibly, manage new AI-specific risks, and ensure compliance with regulations like HIPAA in the age of AI.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Healthcare organizations are rapidly adopting AI for everything from radiology to patient management. This has created a new, poorly understood attack surface and significant data privacy risks that existing regulations do not fully address.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      For healthcare leaders: Direct your CISO and Chief Compliance Officer to review this draft guidance immediately. Use it as a benchmark to perform a gap analysis of your current AI security and governance policies to get ahead of future regulatory requirements.</p>
