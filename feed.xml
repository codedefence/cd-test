      <p>CISA has added a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-61757, CVSS 9.8) in Oracle Identity Manager to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to bypass authentication and take full control of the identity management system.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a maximum-severity risk. Oracle Identity Manager often holds the "keys to the kingdom," managing user access across the entire enterprise. Compromise allows attackers to create privileged accounts, reset passwords, and move laterally into any connected system.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability involves a missing authentication check for a critical function within the Oracle Fusion Middleware component. Attackers are actively exploiting this to hijack identity infrastructure without needing credentials.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This is an emergency. Direct IT to apply the Oracle patches immediately (deadline for federal agencies is Dec 12). If patching is not instant, restrict network access to the Identity Manager console to a secure, isolated management VLAN.</p>

    <title>ShinyHunters Claims Breach of 200+ Companies via Salesforce Gainsight Integration</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/22/shinyhunters-salesforce-gainsight-supply-chain</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/salesforcebreach/800/400" alt="A cloud network diagram showing a broken link between Salesforce and a third-party app." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The ShinyHunters hacking group claims to have compromised over 200 companies by exploiting a supply chain vulnerability in the "Gainsight" customer success platform's integration with Salesforce. The group alleges they have stolen massive amounts of customer data.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This highlights the critical risk of SaaS-to-SaaS integrations. A single compromised integration app can provide a backdoor into the central CRM (Salesforce), exposing customer lists, financial data, and sales pipelines across hundreds of organizations simultaneously.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers reportedly compromised the API connection between Gainsight and Salesforce, leveraging the high-level permissions often granted to integration apps to exfiltrate data from client instances.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your SaaS security team to audit all Salesforce connected apps immediately. Revoke access for any unused integrations and review the permissions granted to Gainsight. Monitor Salesforce access logs for unusual data export activity.</p>

    <title>CrowdStrike Terminates Insider for Leaking Internal Data to Hackers</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/22/crowdstrike-insider-threat-termination</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/insiderthreatcrowd/800/400" alt="A silhouette of a person in a server room handing digital data to a shadowy figure." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike has confirmed the termination of an employee who allegedly shared sensitive internal system details with a hacking collective (reportedly linked to the "Scattered Spider" ecosystem). Leaked screenshots appeared on a public Telegram channel.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This incident serves as a stark reminder that even top-tier security firms are vulnerable to insider threats. It reinforces that technical controls alone cannot stop a trusted insider with legitimate access from leaking sensitive information.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The insider reportedly collaborated with external threat actors, bypassing data loss prevention (DLP) controls to share internal schematics or screenshots. Motives are currently under investigation.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review your Insider Risk Management program. Ensure that privileged access monitoring is in place and that cultural/behavioral indicators of insider risk are being assessed alongside technical logs. Remind staff of the severe legal consequences of data theft.</p>

    <title>New "Matrix Push" C2 Uses Browser Notifications for Fileless Attacks</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/22/matrix-push-c2-browser-notifications</link>

    <category>Malware &amp; Endpoint Security</category>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/browsernotification/800/400" alt="A web browser displaying a malicious push notification popup on a desktop screen." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Researchers have identified "Matrix Push," a new Command and Control (C2) framework that abuses legitimate browser push notifications to execute attacks. It creates a fileless persistence mechanism that is invisible to many traditional antivirus tools.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This technique allows attackers to bypass firewalls and maintain communication with compromised endpoints using standard web traffic (HTTPS). It can be used to deliver phishing links, malvertising, or commands to infected machines without dropping files on the disk.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers are exploiting the native "Push API" in modern browsers. Once a user is tricked into clicking "Allow" on a notification prompt, the browser maintains a persistent connection to the attacker's server, even when the malicious website is closed.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Update browser security policies (Group Policy/MDM) to block push notification requests from all websites by default, or whitelist only approved domains. This eliminates the primary vector for this growing class of "browser-native" attacks.</p>
