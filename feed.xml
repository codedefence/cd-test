      <p><strong>What Happened?</strong><br/>
      A new ISACA tech trends report reveals a major shift in the threat landscape. For the first time, IT and cybersecurity professionals (63%) have cited AI-powered social engineering as the leading cybersecurity threat for the upcoming year, ranking it higher than ransomware (54%) and supply chain attacks (35%).</to>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This marks a critical turning point. Attackers are using AI to create highly convincing deepfakes and personalized phishing lures at scale, making traditional employee training and email filters less effective. Only 13% of security leaders feel "very prepared" to handle these generative AI risks, indicating a significant defensive gap.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The low cost and high availability of generative AI tools have democratized sophisticated social engineering, which was previously a time-consuming, manual process. Attackers can now automate the creation of lures that are contextually aware and linguistically perfect, leading to higher success rates.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Prioritize investment in AI-powered defensive tools that analyze email behavior and context, not just content. The board must also champion a culture of "zero trust verification," where employees are mandated to verify sensitive requests (like wire transfers) through a separate, secure communication channel.</p>

      <p><strong>What Happened?</strong><br/>
      CISA released 10 new Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisories today, warning of critical vulnerabilities in equipment from major vendors including Siemens, Schneider Electric, and Oxford Nanopore. The flaws in Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 CPUs, for example, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service or even bypass authentication.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      These vulnerabilities pose a direct risk to operational technology (OT) in sectors like manufacturing, energy, and healthcare (specifically DNA/RNA sequencing devices). Successful exploitation could halt production, disrupt critical services, or allow an attacker to manipulate physical processes, leading to catastrophic safety and financial consequences.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Many of these flaws, such as improper input validation and missing authentication, are common in legacy ICS equipment that was not designed for the hostility of modern interconnected networks.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct the Head of Operations or Plant Management to work immediately with the CISO to identify if these specific devices are in use. This is a critical risk that requires an urgent patch and segmentation plan to isolate these devices from the business network.</p>

    <title>Over 75,000 WatchGuard Firewalls Remain Unpatched, Exposing Networks to RCE</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/21/watchguard-firewall-vulnerability-unpatched</link>

      <p><strong>What Happened?</strong><br/>
      Despite a patch being available for over a month, new reports indicate that more than 75,000 internet-exposed WatchGuard Firebox appliances remain vulnerable to a critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw (CVE-2025-9242). The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to take full control of the device.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a critical failure in basic patch management. Every unpatched device represents a wide-open door for an attacker to breach a corporate network. This negligence exposes organizations to ransomware, total data exfiltration, and persistent, undetected network access.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The flaw affects devices with the IKEv2 VPN service enabled, a common configuration. The slow patch adoption is likely due to a lack of asset visibility or a failure to prioritize this critical, internet-facing vulnerability.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Mandate an immediate, emergency scan of the network perimeter for any vulnerable WatchGuard devices. This is not a routine task; it is an active incident. If patching cannot be done immediately, the IKEv2 VPN service must be disabled.</p>

    <title>Russian APT "COLDRIVER" Linked to New "LOSTKEYS" Malware</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/21/russia-coldriver-apt-lostkeys-malware</link>

      <p><strong>What Happened?</strong><br/>
      The Russian state-sponsored hacking group COLDRIVER (aka Star Blizzard) has been linked to a new malware family dubbed "LOSTKEYS." Following a public disclosure of one of their implants over the summer, the group rapidly adapted and weaponized this new strain for its espionage campaigns.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      COLDRIVER is a highly persistent threat group that targets governments, research institutions, and NGOs. This new malware demonstrates their agility and resilience, posing a heightened threat of espionage and intellectual property theft to any organization in their target sectors.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Nation-state actors continuously evolve their toolsets to evade detection. When one tool is exposed, they immediately pivot to a new or modified variant to continue operations with minimal disruption.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your threat intelligence team to ensure all security platforms (EDR, SIEM) have the latest indicators of compromise (IoCs) for COLDRIVER and the "LOSTKEYS" malware. This is particularly critical for organizations in government, defense, and research sectors.</p>

    <title>Microsoft 365 Copilot Vulnerability Allows Data Exfiltration via Prompt Injection</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/21/m365-copilot-prompt-injection-vulnerability</link>

      <img src="httpsClick: https://images.pexels.com/photos/4195325/pexels-photo-4195325.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1260&amp;h=750&amp;dpr=1" alt="AI assistant data security vulnerability" style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>What Happened?</strong><br/>
      A vulnerability has been discovered in Microsoft 365 Copilot that allows an attacker to steal sensitive data. By hiding malicious instructions inside documents, an attacker can trick the AI assistant into fetching and exfiltrating sensitive tenant data and user information when another user interacts with that document.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This attack bypasses traditional security boundaries. It turns the organization's own AI assistant into an insider threat, potentially leaking confidential files, user credentials, or strategic plans simply by having an employee "use" Copilot on a weaponized file.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      This is a classic "prompt injection" attack, where the AI cannot distinguish between the user's intended instruction and a malicious instruction embedded in the data it is processing. This is a foundational security flaw in many generative AI systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your Microsoft 365 administrators to review Copilot's data access permissions. This incident proves that Copilot *will* access everything it *can* access. Enforce strict "need-to-know" data permissions and information barriers as a critical compensating control.</p>
