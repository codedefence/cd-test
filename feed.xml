      <p>Government agencies and CERTs worldwide (including India's CERT-In) have issued a high-priority "severe" warning for Google Chrome users. Multiple high-severity vulnerabilities in the V8 engine and WebGPU component allow unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of targeted Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      As the primary business browser, a Chrome RCE (Remote Code Execution) is a catastrophic risk for corporate data. Attackers can steal session tokens, access saved credentials, and move laterally into internal web-based SaaS tools. Successful exploitation can occur simply by a user visiting a compromised or malicious website.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerabilities stem from out-of-bounds memory access in the V8 JavaScript engine and "use-after-free" errors in WebGPU. These memory corruption flaws are a prime target for initial access brokers and nation-state actors seeking a stealthy foothold on employee workstations.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      <strong>Immediate Patching:</strong> Mandate all employees to restart Chrome and verify they are on the latest version. Use your MDM/Endpoint management tools to force a browser update and audit for any devices still running outdated versions by the end of today.</p>

    <title>CISA Adds Digiever NVR Vulnerability to KEV Catalog Amid Active Attacks</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/23/cisa-kev-digiever-nvr-exploitation</link>

      <p>CISA has added a missing authorization vulnerability in Digiever DS-2105 Pro Network Video Recorders (CVE-2023-52163) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. Attackers are actively using this flaw to inject commands and gain unauthorized access to physical security camera systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Compromised NVRs not only expose physical surveillance feeds to attackers but also serve as an ideal persistence point within a network. These devices are often poorly monitored and can be used as jump hosts to launch internal attacks or participate in botnets like Mirai.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The device fails to properly authorize certain CGI requests, allowing attackers to bypass authentication. The continued use of legacy or unmanaged IoT/OT devices in enterprise environments provides an easy entry point for threat actors.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Identify any Digiever NVRs on your network. If they cannot be patched immediately, they must be isolated from the internet and the core corporate network. CISA has set a remediation deadline of January 12, 2026, but the private sector should treat this as urgent.</p>

    <title>Report: 35% of Malware Now Originates in the "Downloads" Directory</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/23/malware-trends-downloads-directory-attack-vector</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/downloads-folder-malware/800/400" alt="A laptop screen with the Downloads folder open, showing icons of 'Invoices' and 'Tools' that are actually malware." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The 2025 OpenText Cybersecurity Threat Report confirms a major tactical shift: over one-third of all business malware is now first detected in the user's "Downloads" folder. Attackers are moving away from email attachments and toward "malvertising" and SEO poisoning to trick users into downloading malicious productivity tools.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This indicates that perimeter email filtering is no longer sufficient. If employees are searching for "PDF merger" or "Network tool" and downloading top-ranked (but poisoned) results, they are voluntarily bringing malware past the firewall. This is particularly dangerous for BYOD and remote workers using personal browsers for work.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The professionalization of cybercrime means attackers now function like legitimate software vendors. They use AI-generated marketing and SEO tactics to ensure their "free" tools appear at the top of search results, effectively outsourcing the delivery of the malware to the user.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Implement "Downloads" folder scanning in your EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) policies. Enhance security awareness training to specifically warn against downloading "free" utilities from unknown websites. Consider "Application Control" to prevent unapproved binaries from running.</p>

    <title>NIST Invests $20M to Secure Critical Infrastructure Against AI Threats</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/23/nist-20m-ai-cybersecurity-critical-infrastructure</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/nist-ai-security/800/400" alt="A high-tech control room representing critical infrastructure, with a holographic shield symbolizing AI-driven defense." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has announced a $20 million investment to establish two new centers focused on AI solutions for manufacturing and cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. This initiative aims to build resilient defenses against AI-powered cyberattacks targeting utilities and transport.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      As nation-states begin using AI to automate the discovery of vulnerabilities in the power grid and water systems, this investment signals a federal-level shift toward AI-native defense. For organizations in critical sectors, this will lead to new standards and compliance requirements for AI-driven monitoring and automated response.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The speed of AI-driven reconnaissance has outpaced human-led defense. NIST recognizes that defending critical infrastructure now requires "defensive AI" that can identify and block anomalous behaviors in real-time before physical damage occurs.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review your 2026 security budget to include "Defensive AI" capabilities. Start aligning your internal AI governance with emerging NIST frameworks to ensure that as you adopt AI, you are also building the monitoring infrastructure to secure it.</p>
