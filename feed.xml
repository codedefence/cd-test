      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> In a "Friday the 13th" scenario, Microsoft has confirmed a critical, unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Exchange Server 2025 and 2022. Dubbed "ProxyVoid," the flaw allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute PowerShell commands as SYSTEM. Active exploitation has been detected against law enforcement and legal firms in the EMEA region.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Critical Emergency. This is a "drop everything" event. If you run on-premise Exchange, your email infrastructure is currently open to full takeover. Attackers are using this to deploy ransomware and exfiltrate entire mailboxes before the weekend begins.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> A deserialization flaw in the Client Access Service (CAS) was discovered by threat actors before Microsoft could release the scheduled Tuesday patch.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> <strong>Immediate Mitigation:</strong> Apply the "One-Click Mitigation Tool" released by Microsoft 2 hours ago. If patching is not possible tonight, block external access to ECP/OWA (port 443) at the firewall level immediately.</p>

    <title>EU AI Act Strikes: €500M Fine for "Shadow AI" Data Scraping</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The European AI Office has levied its first historic fine under the AI Act—€500 million against a major "Shadow AI" provider (unnamed pending appeal) for scraping biometric data without consent to train "Agentic" models. The ruling sets a global precedent: if your AI model cannot prove the lineage of its training data, it is illegal to operate in the EU.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Compliance Risk. This signals the end of the "Wild West" era of AI training. For your clients, this means any vendor providing "AI Agents" must now provide a "Data Provenance Certificate." Using non-compliant AI tools poses a direct liability risk.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The provider, popular among developers for "Vibe Coding," failed to maintain documentation on copyright and consent for its training dataset, violating Article 5 of the EU AI Act.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Request a "Data Lineage Audit" from your top 3 AI vendors by Monday. Ensure your legal team reviews your indemnification clauses for third-party AI tools.</p>

    <title>"FaceSwap-Live" Tool Defeats Video KYC: Banks on High Alert</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/13/faceswap-live-kyc-bypass-banking-fraud</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A new open-source tool, "FaceSwap-Live," has appeared on dark web forums, capable of injecting real-time deepfake video into Android and iOS camera feeds. Security researchers confirmed it successfully bypassed "Liveness Checks" for three major global banks by simulating micro-movements (blinking, head turning) indistinguishable from a real human.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Fraud Risk. "Video KYC" is no longer a silver bullet for identity verification. We expect a surge in "Mule Account" creation this weekend as fraudsters utilize this tool to open accounts using stolen IDs.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The tool exploits the "Virtual Camera" driver on rooted devices, feeding the banking app a pre-rendered, interactive deepfake stream instead of the raw camera sensor data.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Update your KYC protocols to include "Passive Liveness" detection that analyzes skin texture and light reflection, not just movement. Consider requiring "Physical Challenges" (e.g., "Hold up your ID next to your ear") during video calls.</p>

    <title>Bahrain Logistics Alert: "RustBucket" Ransomware Targeting Autonomous Cranes</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/13/rustbucket-ransomware-port-automation-attack</link>
    <pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/13/rustbucket-ransomware-port-automation-attack</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/port-crane/800/400" alt="A shipping port at sunset with automated cranes frozen in place, overlaid with a lock icon." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Threat intelligence indicates a targeted ransomware campaign against automated port terminals in the GCC and Asia. The malware, "RustBucket," specifically targets the PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) of autonomous cranes, locking them in a "Safety Stop" mode that requires a physical key to override.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Supply Chain Paralysis. For logistics hubs in Bahrain, this is a physical denial-of-service attack. If cranes are locked, cargo cannot move, leading to millions in demurrage charges per day.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Attackers gained entry via a compromised third-party maintenance VPN used by the crane manufacturer for remote diagnostics, moving laterally into the OT network.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> <strong>Immediate Action:</strong> Temporarily disable remote maintenance VPNs for all OT equipment this weekend. Verify that your "Manual Override" keys are physically accounted for and accessible to on-site engineers.</p>
