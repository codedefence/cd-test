    <title>U.S. Hospitals Warn of "Black Basta" Ransomware After Wave of Attacks</title>

      <p>Following last week's CISA advisory, multiple U.S. hospital systems are now confirmed to be actively battling intrusions from the "Black Basta" ransomware group. At least two major healthcare providers are diverting ambulances and have shut down EHR systems, indicating a widespread, ongoing campaign.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a direct threat to patient safety and life. The operational shutdown of hospital networks creates chaos, delays critical care, and exposes massive amounts of sensitive patient data (PHI) to exfiltration, leading to severe regulatory (HIPAA) fines and potential loss of life.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Black Basta is known to exploit unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers (like ProxyLogon) and the recent critical Windows Kernel zero-day (CVE-2025-62215) to gain access and escalate privileges rapidly within healthcare networks, which often lag in emergency patching.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      For all healthcare leaders: This is an active, critical threat. Mandate the immediate patching of all Windows and Exchange servers per this week's Patch Tuesday and CISA KEV alerts. Verify that offline, immutable backups are in place and have been recently tested for recovery.</p>

    <title>Critical Zero-Day in Cisco ISE (CVE-2025-20337) Actively Exploited</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/13/cisco-ise-zero-day-cve-2025-20337-exploited</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/ciscoisehack/800/400" alt="A network access control server with a broken digital chain, symbolizing a security bypass." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Cisco has confirmed active exploitation of a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-20337) in its Identity Service Engine (ISE), the central network access control (NAC) solution for many enterprises. The flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain full administrator access to the device.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a "keys to the kingdom" vulnerability. An attacker who controls ISE can control the entire network. They can bypass security segmentation, impersonate any user or device, grant themselves access to all resources, and become virtually undetectable.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability is a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) flaw in an undocumented API endpoint of the ISE. Sophisticated attackers (implying nation-state) discovered and weaponized this flaw to deploy persistent web shells.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your network security team to apply the patches for Cisco ISE immediately. This is a critical priority. Given the active exploitation, you must follow Cisco's guidance to hunt for the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) of the web shell, as patching alone does not remove an existing attacker.</p>

    <title>AI-Powered "Deepfake Phishing" Now Used in 40% of Credential Theft Attacks</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/13/ai-deepfake-phishing-40-percent-credential-theft</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/deepfakephish/800/400" alt="A person's face on a video call glitching and revealing a robotic skull underneath, representing a deepfake." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A new threat report from Proofpoint highlights a massive shift in attack tactics. Nearly 40% of all credential theft attempts now involve some form of AI, including deepfake audio (vishing) or realistic video snippets used in spear-phishing emails to build trust and urgency.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      AI is successfully bypassing the #1 human defense: employee awareness. Your employees are trained to spot bad grammar, but they are not trained to spot a perfect AI-generated voice or video of their CEO or IT director, leading to a much higher success rate for credential harvesting and fraud.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The barrier to creating convincing deepfakes has collapsed. Attackers can now use readily available AI tools to generate realistic audio and video impersonations, automating what was once a highly manual social engineering attack.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Update your security awareness training *immediately* to include examples of AI-driven vishing and video phishing. More importantly, implement hard-to-spoof verification policies (e.g., an out-of-band "safe word" or callback to a known-good number) for all sensitive requests.</p>

    <title>U.S. Government Sanctions North Korean "Pyongyang Cyber Group" for Crypto Heists</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/13/us-sanctions-north-korea-pyongyang-cyber-group</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/nkoreasanction/800/400" alt="The North Korean flag dissolving into a stream of cryptocurrency coins being blocked by a U.S. Treasury seal." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury has sanctioned the "Pyongyang Cyber Group" (PCG), a newly designated North Korean state-sponsored APT. The group is allegedly responsible for stealing over $500 million in 2025 from DeFi protocols and cryptocurrency exchanges to fund state programs.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This sanction blocks all U.S. persons and entities from transacting with the group or their associated crypto wallets. For financial institutions and crypto exchanges, it increases the compliance burden to identify and block these illicit funds, which are often laundered through complex mixing services.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      North Korea (DPRK) uses its sophisticated cyber units as a primary revenue-generating tool for the state, targeting the high-value, decentralized, and often poorly secured DeFi ecosystem to bypass international economic sanctions.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      For leaders in finance or cryptocurrency: Ensure your compliance and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) teams have immediately updated their screening lists with the wallets and aliases associated with PCG. This is a critical step to avoid regulatory penalties for processing illicit funds.</p>

    <title>Critical "FormFusion" WordPress Plugin Flaw Allows Admin Takeover</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/13/wordpress-plugin-formfusion-takeover</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/wordpresshack/800/400" alt="The WordPress logo on a web server with a red, broken link icon, indicating a plugin vulnerability." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A critical (CVSS 9.8) vulnerability has been found in "FormFusion," a WordPress plugin with over 200,000 active installations. The flaw allows any unauthenticated user to update user metadata, including changing the email address and password of an administrator account, leading to a full site takeover.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is an extremely easy-to-exploit vulnerability that leads to a complete compromise of a company's website. Attackers can deface the site, steal customer data, install malware, or use the site's reputation to launch phishing campaigns, causing severe brand damage.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The plugin's developers failed to implement proper authorization checks (a missing capability check) on a function designed to update user profiles, allowing it to be accessed and used by any visitor to the website.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your web or marketing teams to immediately update the "FormFusion" plugin to the latest patched version. Assume any site running a vulnerable version is already compromised and conduct an audit for new or modified administrator accounts and suspicious files.</p>
