Your remote access tools are now the attackers' favorite front door. 🚪

CVE-2026-1731 · Severity 9.9 · Critical unauthenticated remote code execution via WebSocket.

We are seeing attackers exploit @[BeyondTrust](urn:li:organization:12625) Remote Support and PRA instances within hours of exploit code appearing online. These tools are often highly privileged.

Attackers are now using this access to pull credentials directly from vaults. The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog update confirms that mass exploitation is currently underway against unpatched on-premise servers.

The uncomfortable truth: The software you use to secure your environment is becoming your highest-risk point of failure.

→ Patch all self-hosted Remote Support and PRA appliances to version BT26-02 immediately.
→ Restrict appliance web portal access to internal VPN or known IP ranges only.
→ Audit your credential vaults for any unauthorized password or key exports.

Have you verified that your remote support instances are fully patched this morning? 👇

Your browser update cycle is a race against active exploitation. 🌐

CVE-2026-2441 · Severity 8.8 · First actively exploited Chrome zero-day of 2026 targeting CSS components.

We are seeing attackers leverage this use-after-free flaw to execute arbitrary code within the browser sandbox. While @[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) released the patch, manual updates are often too slow for enterprise fleets.

Attackers are now pairing this with social engineering to target high-value corporate users. Compromise happens as soon as a victim visits a malicious or hijacked website.

The uncomfortable truth: Your users are one malicious link away from a system compromise if browser updates aren't automated.

→ Force a global update for all Chrome instances to version 145.0.7632.75 or higher.
→ Monitor endpoint logs for unauthorized shell executions originating from browser processes.
→ Enable hardware-enforced stack protection on all supported enterprise workstations.

Have you automated your browser patch deployment to happen within four hours of release? 👇

Attackers found a way to bypass your Windows security prompts. 🔓

CVE-2026-21510 · Severity 8.8 · Active exploitation of Windows Shell and SmartScreen mechanisms.

We are seeing malicious shortcut files that bypass SmartScreen warnings to execute code silently. These files often arrive via email or hijacked web downloads on @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) systems.

Attackers are now delivering ransomware payloads without triggering a single user warning. This vulnerability exploits improper handling in core Windows Shell components.

The uncomfortable truth: User training won't save you when the operating system fails to provide a warning.

→ Apply the February 2026 security updates to all Windows endpoints immediately.
→ Block the download or execution of .LNK and .URL files from external sources.
→ Enable Attack Surface Reduction rules to prevent shortcuts from launching untrusted code.

Are you still relying on user intuition to spot malicious shortcut files? 👇

Legacy Office components are still the weakest link in your suite. 🖇️

CVE-2026-21514 · Severity 7.8 · Active bypass of OLE mitigations in Microsoft 365.

We are seeing attackers use crafted Word documents to bypass standard OLE security prompts. This allows malicious COM controls to execute with minimal user interaction on @[Microsoft](urn:li:organization:1035) Office.

Attackers are now focusing on these older protocols because they are often overlooked by modern defenses. We've seen this used in targeted phishing against executive leadership teams.

The uncomfortable truth: Your modern cloud security stack is only as strong as the legacy protocols it still supports.

→ Patch all Microsoft 365 and Office installations with the February 2026 updates.
→ Disable OLE object execution in Office via Group Policy for non-essential users.
→ Audit your email sandbox logs for files that attempt to trigger OLE protocol handlers.

Do you know which departments in your organization still rely on legacy OLE functionality? 👇
