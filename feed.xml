      <p>A coordinated cyberattack has hit multiple London councils, significantly disrupting public services and potentially compromising resident data. While the full extent is being investigated, early reports suggest a ransomware incident targeting shared IT infrastructure.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This incident underscores the fragility of public sector IT and the cascading risks of shared service models. Disruption to essential services (housing, benefits) erodes public trust and incurs high recovery costs.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers likely exploited vulnerabilities in a managed service provider (MSP) or shared software platform used by the councils, allowing them to hit multiple targets simultaneously.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review business continuity plans for critical service disruptions. Ensure that third-party vendors and shared service providers adhere to strict security standards and have isolated backup systems.</p>

    <title>Asahi Group Ransomware Breach Exposes 2 Million People</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/asahibreach/800/400" alt="A beverage production line halted by a red digital padlock, symbolizing a ransomware attack." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Asahi Group Holdings has confirmed that a ransomware attack earlier this year resulted in the leakage of personal data belonging to approximately 2 million customers and employees. The Qilin ransomware group has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This massive breach highlights the "long tail" of ransomware incidents. Beyond operational downtime, the exfiltration of employee and customer PII leads to long-term reputational damage, regulatory fines, and potential class-action lawsuits.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Qilin ransomware affiliates target large enterprises using double-extortion tactics. They likely gained initial access via compromised credentials or unpatched VPNs, exfiltrating data before encrypting systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Assume that "encrypt-only" attacks are rare; data theft is the norm. focus heavily on Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and egress filtering to detect large data transfers before encryption occurs.</p>

    <title>CrowdStrike: "DeepSeek" AI Generates Insecure Code on Sensitive Prompts</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/30/crowdstrike-deepseek-ai-insecure-code</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/ai-code-flaw/800/400" alt="An AI interface generating computer code with highlighted security vulnerabilities in red." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>New research from CrowdStrike indicates that the "DeepSeek" AI model is prone to generating code with security flaws when prompts involve politically sensitive topics. This suggests that alignment filters may inadvertently degrade the model's coding capabilities in specific contexts.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This reveals a hidden risk in AI-assisted development. Relying on unvetted or specific foreign AI models for code generation can introduce systemic vulnerabilities into software products, creating a new form of supply chain risk.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The model's training or fine-tuning process appears to prioritize content filtering over code correctness in certain scenarios, leading to the generation of insecure or buggy code structures.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Establish strict governance on which AI coding assistants are permitted. Mandate that all AI-generated code must undergo rigorous human review and automated security scanning (SAST) before deployment.</p>

    <title>CISA Adds OpenPLC ScadaBR Flaw (CVE-2021-26829) to KEV Catalog</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/30/cisa-kev-openplc-scadabr-vulnerability</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/icsvulnerability/800/400" alt="An industrial control panel screen showing a critical alert and a broken circuit connection." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>CISA has added a critical vulnerability in OpenPLC ScadaBR (CVE-2021-26829) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. Though an older CVE, its addition confirms recent active weaponization against industrial control environments.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This flaw affects OT networks using OpenPLC. Exploitation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts or manipulate system settings, potentially disrupting physical industrial processes or using the compromised system as a pivot point into the wider OT network.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the system settings component. Attackers are revisiting older, unpatched OT vulnerabilities because many industrial environments operate on "legacy" cycles and remain unpatched for years.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct OT security teams to audit for OpenPLC usage immediately. Apply patches or isolate affected systems behind strict firewalls. Ensure that no ICS/SCADA interfaces are exposed to the public internet.</p>

    <title>Tenable CEO Warns of "Machine-Speed" Attacks, Pushes Exposure Management</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/30/tenable-ceo-exposure-management-warning</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/cyberstrategy/800/400" alt="A strategic chessboard with digital pieces moving at high speed, representing machine-speed cyber defense." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Ahead of Black Hat MEA, Tenable CEO Mark Thurmond has issued a warning that traditional security models are failing against "machine-speed" attacks. He advocates for a shift to "Exposure Management," using AI to prioritize the 1-3% of vulnerabilities that actually pose a risk.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This reflects a strategic pivot for CISOs. The volume of vulnerabilities is unmanageable manually. Adopting exposure management allows organizations to move from "patching everything" (impossible) to "patching what matters" (effective), reducing real-world risk more efficiently.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The attack surface has expanded exponentially (Cloud, OT, Identity). Attackers use automation to exploit flaws faster than defenders can patch. Defensive strategies must evolve to be predictive and risk-based rather than reactive.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Evaluate your vulnerability management program. Is it just counting bugs, or is it measuring risk? Consider adopting Exposure Management platforms that correlate vulnerabilities with threat intelligence and asset criticality to prioritize remediation.</p>
