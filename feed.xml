      <p>Okta has released emergency patches for a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-10099) affecting its standard authentication API. The flaw allows an attacker with a valid username to bypass password and MFA requirements under specific high-load conditions due to a race condition in the validation logic.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a catastrophic risk for organizations relying on Okta for Single Sign-On (SSO). It potentially allows attackers to gain full access to all integrated corporate applications (email, cloud storage, CRM, HR systems) as any user, without needing credentials.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      A complex race condition in the session token generation process could be triggered deliberately by attackers flooding the authentication service, causing it to fail open and issue a valid token without completing all security checks.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Treat this as an immediate emergency. Direct IT to verify with Okta that your tenant is patched (for cloud customers) or apply patches immediately (for on-prem Access Gateway). Mandate an immediate review of all admin logins from the past 24 hours for anomalies.</p>

    <title>Volt Typhoon Hackers Found Lurking in US Power Grids for 6 Months</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/powergridhack/800/400" alt="High-voltage power lines silhouetted against a dark, stormy digital sky." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A joint advisory from CISA, NSA, and FBI confirms that the China-state-sponsored group "Volt Typhoon" has successfully infiltrated multiple US power grid operators and maintained undetected access for at least six months. They used "living off the land" techniques, leveraging legitimate admin tools to blend in.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a pre-positioning attack for potential future sabotage. The actors didn't steal data but entrenched themselves deep within critical OT networks, giving them the capability to disrupt power supply during a future geopolitical crisis.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The group exploited old, forgotten SOHO routers and VPN concentrators at the network edge to gain initial entry, then used stolen valid credentials to move laterally, avoiding malware that would trigger traditional EDR alerts.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Critical infrastructure leaders must mandate a "hunting forward" exercise. Assume standard detection has failed. Manually review account activity for legitimate tools (PowerShell, WMI) being used in unusual ways. Reset all privileged account credentials immediately.</p>

    <title>AI Botnet "HiveMind" Discovered Using IoT Devices for Password Cracking</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/09/hivemind-ai-botnet-iot-password-cracking</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/aibotnet/800/400" alt="Network of connected smart home devices forming a glowing, malicious hive mind structure." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Researchers have identified "HiveMind," a novel botnet comprised of millions of compromised IoT devices (cameras, routers). Unlike traditional DDoS botnets, HiveMind uses a distributed, AI-driven engine to intelligently coordinate brute-force and credential stuffing attacks against high-value corporate targets.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This represents a massive escalation in credential attacks. The AI coordinator allows the botnet to adapt its attack patterns in real-time to bypass rate-limiting and standard Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules, making account takeovers highly efficient and difficult to stop.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers are leveraging the collective processing power of unsecure IoT devices to run lightweight AI inference models, allowing the botnet to make autonomous targeting decisions without the need for constant command-and-control communication.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your security team to review WAF and identity protection configurations. Static rate-limiting is no longer enough. Implement AI-driven behavioral analysis for login attempts to detect these "low-and-slow," distributed AI-coordinated attacks.</p>

    <title>New "Clop" Ransomware Zero-Day Hits Secure File Transfer Tool "SafeMove"</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/09/clop-ransomware-safemove-zero-day</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/filetransferhack/800/400" alt="A secure file folder icon being broken open by a red digital crowbar." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>The Clop ransomware gang has returned with a new mass-exploitation campaign, this time targeting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-7788) in "SafeMove," a popular managed file transfer (MFT) solution used by enterprises to share sensitive data.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Similar to the MOVEit attacks of 2023, this is a mass data theft event. Organizations using SafeMove likely have highly sensitive data (PII, financial records, intellectual property) currently being exfiltrated by the terabyte, leading to massive regulatory and extortion risks.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Clop specializes in finding SQL injection vulnerabilities in internet-facing MFT appliances. This allows them to bypass authentication and directly query the database to download all stored files.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      If your organization uses SafeMove, take it offline immediately. Do not wait for a patch. Assume all data on the appliance has been stolen. Activate your incident response plan and begin legal counsel regarding breach notification requirements.</p>
