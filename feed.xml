    <title>USSD Call-Forwarding Scams Hijack Banking OTPs via Social Engineering</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) has issued a high-priority alert regarding scammers posing as delivery agents. They trick users into dialing USSD codes like *401*# followed by an attacker's number. This silently enables unconditional call forwarding, allowing hackers to intercept voice-call OTPs and reset banking credentials.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High risk for corporate finance teams. If an employee is targeted, the attacker can bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to authorize fraudulent wire transfers. It renders voice-based 2FA completely ineffective.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Fraudsters exploit the trust in delivery services and the lack of visible confirmation for USSD network commands. Since call forwarding happens at the telecom network level, the phone appears normal to the victim.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Issue an immediate internal advisory: "Never dial codes provided by unknown callers." Move your organization away from SMS and voice-based OTPs, favoring hardware keys (FIDO2) or authenticator apps.</p>

    <title>CISA KEV Update: HPE OneView Code Injection (CVE-2025-37164) Under Active Attack</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/09/cisa-kev-hpe-oneview-exploit</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> CISA has added a maximum-severity vulnerability in HPE OneView to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. This 10.0 CVSS flaw allows unauthenticated remote code execution. Attackers are currently using it to gain lateral movement within enterprise data centers.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Critical. OneView manages entire server infrastructures. A compromise here allows an attacker to seize control of bare-metal servers, storage, and networking across your entire hybrid cloud environment.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have weaponized this code injection flaw to target high-value government and corporate infrastructure that hasn't yet applied the 2025 holiday patches.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Direct your infrastructure team to patch HPE OneView immediately. If patching is not possible tonight, isolate the management interface (VLAN) from the rest of the production network.</p>

    <title>Google Gemini 3 Transformation: Gmail AI Inbox Replaces Manual Filters</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/09/gmail-gemini-3-ai-inbox-security</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Google has officially entered the "Gemini Era" for Gmail, rolling out an AI-driven inbox that uses the Gemini 3 model to understand intent and context. Crucially, the system now prioritizes emails based on "relationship behavior" rather than keywords, effectively neutralizing traditional phishing lures that rely on urgency.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> This significantly reduces the volume of malicious emails reaching employee eyes. However, it introduces "Shadow AI" risk as employees may over-rely on AI summaries of sensitive legal or financial documents, potentially missing nuanced security warnings.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Phishing has become too fast for manual filters. Google is leveraging its latest LLM to detect the "intent" of an attacker, even if the email contains no known malicious links or attachments.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Update your Data Privacy Policy to address how AI summaries handle sensitive corporate data. Ensure your security team monitors Gemini's output for potential "hallucinated" security advice.</p>

    <title>LockBit 5 Strikes Manufacturing: Eros Elevators Data Breach Investigation</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/09/lockbit-eros-elevators-breach</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/elevator-hack/800/400" alt="An elevator control panel with a digital skull and crossbones icon." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The LockBit 5 ransomware group has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Eros Elevators, a major industrial manufacturer. The group claims to have exfiltrated significant operational data and is threatening to leak it unless demands are met.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Manufacturing and OT (Operational Technology) security is under siege. This breach could expose proprietary blueprints, client lists, and service schedules, leading to massive competitive disadvantage and potential physical safety concerns for lift systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> LockBit remains highly active despite law enforcement efforts, continuing to target mid-sized industrial firms with weak network segmentation between IT and OT systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Conduct an immediate audit of your network segmentation. Ensure your OT environment (factory floor) is "air-gapped" or behind a highly restrictive firewall from the corporate IT network.</p>
