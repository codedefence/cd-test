      <p>CISA has officially added the "React2Shell" vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. This critical RCE flaw in React Server Components is being actively exploited by Chinese state-sponsored groups (Earth Lamia, Jackpot Panda) and botnets. Over 2.15 million internet-facing services are potentially exposed.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a widespread emergency for any organization using modern web frameworks (Next.js, React). Unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code on servers without any user interaction. The sheer scale of exposed services makes this a prime target for automated ransomware and crypto-mining campaigns.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The flaw involves insecure deserialization in the React Flight protocol. Attackers can send specially crafted payloads to Server Function endpoints to bypass security controls and execute commands.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct development teams to update React packages to version 19.0.1 or later immediately. Federal agencies have a strict deadline to patch (Dec 26), but private sector leaders should treat this as a 24-hour remediation window.</p>

    <title>Avast Antivirus Kernel Flaws Allow Sandbox Escape to SYSTEM</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/06/avast-antivirus-kernel-sandbox-escape</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/avastkernel/800/400" alt="An antivirus shield icon cracking open, revealing kernel code underneath." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Security researchers have disclosed four critical kernel heap overflow vulnerabilities (collectively CVE-2025-13032) in the Avast Antivirus `aswSnx` kernel driver. These flaws allow a local attacker to escape the antivirus sandbox and escalate privileges to SYSTEM level on Windows 11.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Vulnerabilities in security software are particularly dangerous as they run with the highest privileges. An attacker who has already gained a foothold (e.g., via phishing) can use this flaw to disable defenses, gain total control of the endpoint, and persist deeply within the OS.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerabilities stem from "double fetch" race conditions in how the kernel driver handles user data, allowing attackers to manipulate memory allocations and trigger a buffer overflow.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Ensure all endpoints running Avast (or Gen Digital products sharing the same driver) are updated to version 25.2.9898.0 or later. Verify that your endpoint management systems are successfully pushing these updates to all remote workers.</p>

    <title>Barts Health NHS Trust Confirms Data Breach via Cl0p Ransomware</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/06/barts-health-nhs-clop-ransomware-breach</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/nhshack/800/400" alt="A hospital building with a digital data leak warning overlay." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Barts Health NHS Trust, one of the largest healthcare trusts in the UK, has confirmed that the Cl0p ransomware group stole sensitive files from its invoice databases. This breach is a direct result of the mass exploitation of the Oracle E-Business Suite vulnerability tracked last month.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      The stolen data includes names and addresses of patients and staff payment details. While clinical systems were not encrypted, the exposure of patient data creates significant regulatory liability (GDPR) and distress for patients. It highlights the long-tail impact of supply chain software vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Cl0p targets organizations running unpatched enterprise software (like Oracle EBS) to steal data at scale for extortion, often bypassing encryption to focus purely on data theft.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review your organization's exposure to Oracle E-Business Suite. If you use it, ensure it is fully patched and behind a VPN. Implement strict egress filtering to detect large data transfers from administrative servers.</p>

    <title>Microsoft &amp; Google Launch "Agent 365" to Govern AI Agent Sprawl</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/06/microsoft-google-agent-365-launch</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/agent365/800/400" alt="A futuristic dashboard monitoring multiple AI agents, symbolizing governance and control." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Responding to the rapid rise of "Shadow AI," major tech players including Microsoft and Google have rolled out new governance platforms (like "Agent 365") designed to discover, monitor, and secure autonomous AI agents within the enterprise. This move aims to prevent data leakage from unauthorized bots.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      "Agent sprawl" is the new shadow IT. Employees are deploying autonomous agents to automate tasks without security oversight. These platforms provide the necessary visibility to prevent these agents from accidentally exposing sensitive data or being hijacked by attackers.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The adoption of agentic AI has outpaced traditional security controls. Security teams currently lack visibility into what AI agents are running on their networks and what data they are accessing.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your CIO/CISO to evaluate these new governance tools immediately. You cannot secure what you cannot see. Establishing a policy and control plane for AI agents is now a critical requirement for 2026 planning.</p>
