    <description><![CDATA[
      
      <p>Atlassian released emergency patches for a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2025-9115, CVSS 9.8) affecting Confluence Data Center and Server. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code. CISA has added it to the KEV catalog, confirming active exploitation in the wild.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Confluence often stores sensitive project plans, internal documentation, and knowledge bases. A successful RCE attack allows attackers complete control over the Confluence server, enabling data theft, deployment of ransomware, or lateral movement into other corporate systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability exists in how Confluence handles certain web requests, allowing attackers to bypass authentication and achieve code execution. Such flaws in widely deployed collaboration tools are high-value targets for attackers.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Treat this as a critical emergency. Direct IT teams to apply the Atlassian patches immediately to all affected Confluence instances. Prioritize internet-facing servers. Hunt for IoCs provided by Atlassian and CISA, as systems may already be compromised.</p>

    <title>AI-Powered Vishing Attacks Bypass Traditional Call Center Security</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/29/ai-vishing-attacks-bypass-call-center-security</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      
      <p>Threat actors are using real-time AI voice modification and deepfake audio to bypass voice biometric authentication and trick human agents in call centers (vishing - voice phishing). They can convincingly impersonate customers to perform account takeovers or authorize fraudulent transactions.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This significantly increases the risk of fraud and account takeover (ATO) originating through customer support channels. It undermines trust in voice-based security measures and can lead to substantial financial losses and reputational damage for banks, telcos, and other service providers.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      AI voice technology has advanced to the point where it can convincingly mimic specific individuals in real-time or generate realistic voices that fool both automated systems and human listeners, especially in the context of a brief call center interaction.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review call center authentication procedures. Implement multi-factor authentication beyond simple voice recognition or knowledge-based questions (KBAs). Train agents to recognize potential signs of AI-generated audio and escalate suspicious calls for further verification.</p>

    <title>New "DataViper" Ransomware Targets Misconfigured Databases</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/29/dataviper-ransomware-targets-databases</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:45:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/29/dataviper-ransomware-targets-databases</guid>
    <category>Ransomware &amp; Data Security</category>
    <description><![CDATA[
      
      <p>A new ransomware variant named "DataViper" has emerged, specifically scanning the internet for and targeting publicly exposed, misconfigured databases (like MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis). Instead of encrypting entire systems, it encrypts the database contents directly and leaves a ransom note.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This automated attack rapidly compromises critical data stores that may power customer applications or internal operations. Loss of access to key databases can halt business functions, and data exfiltration before encryption adds significant breach notification and regulatory risks.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Attackers exploit the common misconfiguration of databases left exposed to the internet without proper authentication or firewall rules. DataViper automates the discovery and exploitation of these low-hanging fruit.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Mandate an immediate audit of all database instances (cloud and on-prem) to ensure they are not publicly exposed and have strong authentication enabled. Implement automated configuration scanning (like CSPM for cloud) to detect and alert on such misconfigurations proactively.</p>

    <title>Iranian APT "Charming Kitten" Uses New Backdoor in Espionage Campaigns</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/29/iranian-apt-charming-kitten-new-backdoor</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:40:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/29/iranian-apt-charming-kitten-new-backdoor</guid>
    <category>Geopolitics &amp; Nation-State Threats</category>
    <description><![CDATA[
      
      <p>The Iranian state-sponsored group Charming Kitten (aka APT35, Phosphorus) has been observed deploying a previously unseen backdoor named "GhostEcho." The group uses sophisticated spear-phishing campaigns targeting academics, journalists, and human rights organizations, particularly those focused on Middle Eastern affairs.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Charming Kitten focuses on espionage and credential theft. A successful compromise can lead to the exfiltration of sensitive research, communications, contact lists, and long-term surveillance of targeted individuals and organizations, potentially undermining diplomatic efforts or compromising activists.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Nation-state groups continuously develop new malware and refine their TTPs to evade detection by security tools and maintain persistence within target networks for intelligence gathering.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Ensure threat intelligence platforms are updated with IoCs for Charming Kitten and the "GhostEcho" backdoor. Remind high-risk employees (executives, researchers in relevant fields) to be extremely cautious of spear-phishing attempts and enable robust MFA on all accounts.</p>

    <title>Critical Vulnerability in Popular WordPress Plugin "FormCraft Pro" Allows Site Takeover</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/29/wordpress-plugin-formcraft-pro-vulnerability</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 16:35:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/10/29/wordpress-plugin-formcraft-pro-vulnerability</guid>
    <category>Top Incident/Vulnerability &amp; Web Security</category>
    <description><![CDATA[
      
      <p>A critical unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability (CVE-2025-5678, CVSS 9.8) has been found in the FormCraft Pro WordPress plugin, installed on thousands of websites. The flaw allows attackers to upload malicious files (like web shells) and gain complete control over the affected website.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      Website takeover can lead to defacement, hosting of malicious content, redirection of visitors to phishing sites, theft of customer data submitted through forms, and significant reputational damage. Compromised sites can also be used to launch attacks against visitors or other systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability likely stems from insufficient validation of file types or paths during the file upload process handled by the plugin, allowing attackers to bypass security checks and place executable code on the web server.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct web administrators to immediately update the FormCraft Pro plugin to the latest patched version or disable and remove it if an update is not possible. Implement a web application firewall (WAF) to help block malicious file uploads.</p>
