Your file transfer gateway is now an active execution point for attackers. 📂

CVE-2026-25108 · Severity 9.8 · Critical OS Command Injection in Soliton Systems FileZen.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has confirmed active exploitation of @[Soliton Systems](urn:li:organization:166291) FileZen appliances within the last 24 hours. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary system commands via a crafted network request.

Attackers are currently leveraging this to establish initial access and move laterally into corporate networks. Because these devices handle sensitive file transfers, they serve as a high-value bridge between internal and external segments.

The uncomfortable truth: Your secure file transfer appliance is a prime target for attackers looking to bypass your perimeter without needing stolen credentials.

→ Update all @[Soliton Systems](urn:li:organization:166291) FileZen instances to version 5.0.11 immediately.
→ Reset all administrative and account passwords once the patch is applied.
→ Audit your network logs for unusual outbound traffic originating from file transfer nodes.

Have you confirmed that your file transfer appliances are fully patched and isolated from direct internet access? 👇

AI-powered assembly lines are now breaching firewalls at global scale. 🤖

Over 600 firewalls breached across 55 countries in just five weeks using generative AI tools.

Security research from @[Amazon](urn:li:organization:1586) reveals that financially motivated threat actors are using commercial AI to automate the discovery and exploitation of weak credentials and single-factor authentication. This has allowed even low-skilled attackers to compromise network devices at an unprecedented scale.

The campaign has successfully impacted firewalls in South Asia, Latin America, and Northern Europe. Once inside, attackers are attempting to pivot further into the network to set up ransomware operations.

The uncomfortable truth: Your firewall is only as strong as its weakest authentication point, and AI has just made finding that weakness instantaneous.

→ Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access to network devices.
→ Conduct an immediate audit of firewall login credentials to eliminate simple or default passwords.
→ Monitor for rapid-fire login attempts that may indicate AI-driven automated brute forcing.

Are you still relying on single-factor authentication for your core network security infrastructure? 👇

A decade-long espionage apparatus was just dismantled by threat researchers. 🛡️

53 organizations globally · Compromised by a Chinese-linked hacking group using legitimate cloud tools.

@[Google](urn:li:organization:1441) has disrupted the "Gallium" (UNC2814) cluster, which targeted government and telecommunications entities across 42 countries. The group used @[Google Sheets](urn:li:organization:1441) to blend their command-and-control traffic with normal network activity, making detection nearly impossible for standard tools.

The group successfully exfiltrated call records and monitored SMS messages through lawful intercept capabilities. This disruption involved disabling the accounts and infrastructure used to manage the stolen data.

The uncomfortable truth: Advanced actors are hiding in the cloud tools your business uses every day, making your own "allow-listed" traffic your biggest blind spot.

→ Review and restrict third-party cloud app permissions across your environment.
→ Monitor for unusual data exfiltration patterns to common SaaS platforms like Sheets or Drive.
→ Audit your telecommunications lawful intercept interfaces for unauthorized access or configuration changes.

How well does your SOC differentiate between legitimate cloud tool usage and malicious data exfiltration? 👇

Unauthenticated command execution can turn your routers into entry points. 🛑

Critical Severity · RCE vulnerability affecting over a dozen @[Zyxel](urn:li:organization:10952) router models.

We are seeing reports of a critical flaw that allows unauthenticated attackers to gain remote command execution on unpatched @[Zyxel](urn:li:organization:10952) networking devices. This vulnerability provides a direct pathway for attackers to bypass edge security and establish persistence.

Updates have been released to address this issue across affected models. Failure to patch allows attackers to pivot from the edge into the internal management network, potentially compromising sensitive corporate traffic.

The uncomfortable truth: Your edge networking gear is the first line of defense, but also the first point of failure if it is not regularly audited and patched.

→ Patch all @[Zyxel](urn:li:organization:10952) routers to the latest firmware version immediately.
→ Disable remote management interfaces on routers unless absolutely required for operations.
→ Ensure all networking gear is included in your automated vulnerability scanning schedule.

Is your edge hardware currently part of your automated patch management cycle? 👇
