Organized AI-powered attacks are now targeting national digital platforms. 🇦🇪

Sophisticated actors are using generative AI to adapt malicious tools in real-time, according to the @[UAE Cybersecurity Council](urn:li:organization:71112480). This wave specifically targets vital infrastructure and government digital services.

We are seeing a shift where AI is used not just for phishing, but to automate the exploitation of discovered network gaps at a speed that traditional SOC teams struggle to match. These attacks are coordinated and designed to destabilize essential services.

The uncomfortable truth: Your defensive response time must now be measured in seconds, as attackers have successfully automated the "human" part of the attack chain.

→ Review and harden access to all public-facing government and critical infrastructure APIs.
→ Deploy AI-augmented monitoring to detect automated, adaptive lateral movement.
→ Conduct a tabletop exercise focused on high-speed, automated extortion scenarios.

Is your incident response plan fast enough to counter an attack that adapts every few seconds? 👇

Attackers are using your remote support tools to deploy ransomware. 🔓

CVE-2026-1731 · Severity 9.9 · Critical unauthenticated RCE in Remote Support and PRA tools.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has confirmed that this vulnerability is now being actively weaponized by ransomware groups. Attackers are bypassing authentication to deploy VShell and achieve full administrative persistence.

This affects self-hosted @[BeyondTrust](urn:li:organization:12625) instances that haven't applied the emergency patches. Because these tools have high-level access to your endpoints, a compromise here is often a "game over" scenario for the domain.

The uncomfortable truth: The tools you trust most for remote administration are currently the highest-value targets for initial network entry.

→ Patch all self-hosted Remote Support and PRA appliances to version BT26-02 immediately.
→ Restrict management portal access to internal VPN or verified IP ranges only.
→ Audit your credential vaults for any unauthorized exports or new admin account creations.

Have you verified your remote support tool logs for unauthorized command execution today? 👇

A new supply chain worm is siphoning enterprise API keys and secrets. 🐚

A cluster of at least 19 malicious npm packages has been identified in an active credential harvesting campaign. This "Shai-Hulud" worm automatically propagates by abusing stolen @[GitHub](urn:li:organization:1118635) identities.

The malicious code targets developer environments to steal environment secrets, access tokens, and cloud API keys. Once a developer is compromised, the worm uses their credentials to publish trojanized versions of legitimate packages to extend its reach.

The uncomfortable truth: Your internal software supply chain is only as secure as the personal GitHub account of your most distracted developer.

→ Run a scan of all internal node_modules for known malicious package fingerprints.
→ Enforce hardware-based MFA for all npm and GitHub account access.
→ Implement secrets scanning to prevent API keys from being stored in environment variables.

Do you have visibility into which third-party packages are currently running in your dev environments? 👇

Your webmail is a silent gateway for state-sponsored data theft. 📧

CVE-2025-49113 · Severity 9.9 · Critical deserialization vulnerability in Roundcube Webmail.

The @[CISA](urn:li:organization:13010360) has recently added this to the KEV catalog as APT groups continue to exploit unpatched servers. This flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain access to sensitive mail data.

We are seeing a surge in automated scanning for this specific vulnerability. Because webmail is often exposed to the public internet, it serves as a low-resistance entry point for lateral movement into the broader corporate network.

The uncomfortable truth: If your webmail is unpatched, your private communications have likely already been ingested by an automated collection script.

→ Update Roundcube Webmail to the latest stable release (1.6.11+) immediately.
→ Audit mail server logs for unauthorized PHP object deserialization attempts.
→ Review your DMZ architecture to ensure mail servers are properly segmented.

Are you still running legacy on-premise webmail interfaces exposed to the public internet? 👇
