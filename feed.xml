      <p>CISA has added the critical Palo Alto GlobalProtect VPN vulnerability (CVE-2025-9901) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, confirming it is under widespread, active exploitation. The CVSS 10.0 flaw allows unauthenticated remote code execution and full firewall takeover.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is the highest possible alert. Attackers are actively compromising unpatched corporate firewalls to gain full network access. A compromised VPN gateway allows for total data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, and persistent, stealthy access to the internal network.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the GlobalProtect portal's web interface, which is internet-facing by design. Attackers are now scanning the internet and automatically compromising any unpatched devices.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      This is an "all-hands-on-deck" emergency. If your organization has not applied the hotfixes from Palo Alto Networks, you must assume you are compromised. Patching is not enough; you must immediately activate your incident response plan and hunt for IoCs.</p>

    <title>North Korean Hackers "Lazarus Group" Deploy New AI-Powered Phishing Lures</title>

      <p>The North Korean state-sponsored Lazarus Group is now using generative AI to enhance its spear-phishing campaigns. Researchers report the group is using AI to create linguistically perfect, context-aware emails and fake professional profiles on LinkedIn to target employees in the cryptocurrency and defense sectors.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      AI removes the classic red flags (e.g., poor grammar, awkward phrasing) that employees are trained to spot. This makes the Lazarus Group's phishing attempts significantly more convincing, increasing their success rate in stealing credentials, compromising networks, and stealing millions in cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Generative AI allows non-native English-speaking APT groups to craft flawless social engineering lures at scale, effectively bypassing human vigilance and traditional email filters that look for spam-like characteristics.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Update security awareness training immediately. Emphasize that "perfect" grammar is no longer a sign of a safe email. Mandate the use of phishing-resistant MFA (like FIDO2/passkeys) to render stolen credentials useless.</p>

    <title>Critical Flaw in "OpenFlow" SDN Controller (CVE-2025-11290) Allows Network Takeover</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/15/openflow-sdn-controller-vulnerability</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="httpss://picsum.photos/seed/sdnhack/800/400" alt="A digital visualization of a software-defined network (SDN) with a red, broken link in the central controller." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>A critical (CVSS 9.8) vulnerability has been disclosed in the "OpenFlow" Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller, a popular open-source component used in many enterprise and datacenter network fabrics. The flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain full administrative control of the SDN controller.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a catastrophic network infrastructure vulnerability. The SDN controller is the "brain" of the entire network. An attacker who controls it can silently intercept, redirect, or monitor all network traffic, bypass all firewalls and segmentation, and gain access to every connected system.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability is an authentication bypass in the controller's REST API, allowing attackers to send malicious, unauthenticated requests that are processed as if they came from an administrator.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your network engineering team to patch all OpenFlow-based SDN controllers immediately. Ensure that the management interfaces for all network infrastructure (controllers, switches, firewalls) are on a segregated, secure management network, never exposed to the internet or internal user networks.</p>

    <title>BlackCat Ransomware Gang Leaks 10TB of Alleged U.S. State Dept. Data</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/11/15/blackcat-leaks-us-state-dept-data</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/blackcatleak/800/400" alt="A computer screen showing a 'Data Leak in Progress' bar with the BlackCat ransomware logo." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Following through on their threat from last week, the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware gang has begun leaking the 10TB of data they claim to have stolen from the U.S. State Department. The initial leak includes internal documents, personnel lists, and what appear to be diplomatic communications.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a major national security incident. The public release of this sensitive data endangers U.S. personnel, compromises diplomatic negotiations, and provides a trove of intelligence to foreign adversaries. The State Department has not confirmed the authenticity but is "aware of the claims."</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      This is a classic double-extortion tactic. The leak is designed to inflict maximum reputational damage and pressure the U.S. government (which has a strict no-pay policy) after negotiations failed. The initial access vector remains unknown but was likely a known, unpatched vulnerability.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      While a government breach, this reinforces the need for rapid detection and response. Mandate a review of your organization's data exfiltration controls. Ensure that detection for large, anomalous outbound data transfers is in place and that the SOC is empowered to block such transfers immediately.</p>
