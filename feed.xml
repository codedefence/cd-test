      <p>A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182, CVSS 10.0), dubbed "React2Shell," has been disclosed in the React and Next.js web frameworks. The flaw allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on servers by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to endpoints using React Server Components (RSC).</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a "code red" for web application security. React is the backbone of the modern web. This vulnerability exposes millions of websites and enterprise applications to immediate server takeover. Attackers can steal data, install crypto-miners, or pivot into backend cloud environments with ease.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The vulnerability involves improper decoding of payloads sent to React Server Function endpoints. Even applications that don't explicitly use these functions may be vulnerable if RSC support is enabled in the framework's default configuration.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Direct your engineering/DevOps leads to update React (to v19.0.1+) and Next.js immediately. If patching is delayed, implement WAF rules (released by Cloudflare/AWS) to block the specific malicious HTTP patterns associated with this exploit.</p>

    <title>CISA Warns of "BRICKSTORM" Malware Targeting Critical Infrastructure</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/brickstorm/800/400" alt="A digital storm cloud over a power grid, symbolizing a state-sponsored cyber threat to infrastructure." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>CISA, the NSA, and the Canadian Cyber Centre have issued a joint advisory on "BRICKSTORM," a sophisticated backdoor malware used by PRC (China) state-sponsored actors. The malware specifically targets VMware vCenter servers and Windows environments within critical infrastructure sectors to maintain persistent, long-term access.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This malware is a tool for pre-positioning. It doesn't just steal data; it digs in deep to allow for potential future disruption or sabotage of critical services (energy, water, transport). Its ability to move laterally and reinstall itself makes remediation extremely difficult.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      State actors are targeting the virtualization layer (VMware) because it is a "single point of failure" for modern data centers. Compromising vCenter grants administrative control over all virtual machines running on the infrastructure.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Mandate a threat hunt for the specific IoCs provided in the CISA advisory, focusing on your virtualization infrastructure. Ensure vCenter servers are not internet-facing and are segmented from the general corporate network.</p>

    <title>Record-Breaking 29.7 Tbps DDoS Attack Launched by "Aisuru" Botnet</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/04/record-29tbps-ddos-aisuru-botnet</link>

    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/ddosattack/800/400" alt="A massive wave of digital red traffic overwhelming a server globe, representing a record DDoS attack." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Cloudflare has reported mitigating the largest DDoS attack in history, peaking at a staggering 29.7 Terabits per second (Tbps). The attack was launched by a new botnet named "Aisuru," comprised of millions of compromised IoT devices, and targeted financial services and telecom providers.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      The scale of this attack (nearly double previous records) is an existential threat to online availability. An attack of this magnitude can overwhelm not just a target's servers, but their upstream ISP links, causing collateral internet outages for entire regions.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      The "Aisuru" botnet has rapidly grown by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in consumer routers and smart devices. It is reportedly being rented out as a "booter" service, democratizing military-grade censorship capabilities for cybercriminals.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Verify your DDoS mitigation SLAs. Ensure your provider can handle terabit-scale volumetric attacks. If you self-host critical services, consider a hybrid or cloud-based mitigation strategy to absorb this level of traffic.</p>

    <title>Marquis Software Breach Exposes Data for Dozens of U.S. Banks</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2025/12/04/marquis-software-breach-us-banks</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/bankdata/800/400" alt="A bank vault door slightly ajar with digital binary code leaking out, symbolizing a financial data breach." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p>Marquis Software Solutions, a vendor for the financial industry, has disclosed a data breach impacting dozens of U.S. banks and credit unions. Attackers accessed files containing sensitive customer PII, including SSNs and financial account numbers, affecting over 42,000 individuals in Maine alone.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact</strong><br/>
      This is a classic supply chain failure. Financial institutions that securely managed their own networks were compromised via a third-party marketing vendor. This triggers mandatory breach notifications, potential fines, and a loss of customer trust for the affected banks.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened</strong><br/>
      Unauthorized actors gained access to the vendor's network in August 2025. The delay in detection and notification (nearly 4 months) highlights gaps in vendor incident response capabilities and monitoring.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action</strong><br/>
      Review your vendor portfolio for "data aggregators" like marketing firms. Ensure they are held to the same rigorous security and breach notification standards as your core financial processors. Enforce the right to audit their security posture.</p>
