      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A significant security incident has hit SoundCloud, exposing the personal details of nearly 30 million unique accounts. The breach, which originated from an "unauthorized mapping and data enumeration" attack on its API, includes email addresses, full names, and profile metadata. The data was indexed by breach notification services today, January 28.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High risk of credential stuffing and spear-phishing. For corporate environments, this leak provides a map of employee email addresses and social identifiers that can be used to craft convincing social engineering attacks against your internal staff.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Threat actors exploited a lack of rate-limiting and robust authentication on a legacy API endpoint, allowing them to systematically scrape the user database over several months.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Remind staff that personal account breaches often lead to corporate phishing. Mandate a change of any passwords that were shared between SoundCloud and corporate accounts (though this practice should already be banned via policy).</p>

    <title>Urgent: Fortinet Warns of Actively Exploited FortiCloud SSO Flaw (CVE-2026-24858)</title>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Fortinet has issued a critical advisory for a zero-day authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-24858) in its FortiCloud Single Sign-On (SSO) service. Attackers are currently exploiting this flaw to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain administrative access to managed security fabric nodes.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Critical. If your security infrastructure uses FortiCloud for centralized management, an attacker could potentially gain "System" level access to your firewalls and network gates, allowing for silent traffic interception and data exfiltration.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> A flaw in the way the SSO service validates session tokens allowed for "Token Replay" attacks, where a malicious actor could reuse a stolen or intercepted session ID to authenticate as a valid admin.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> <strong>Patch Immediately.</strong> Review logs for any unauthorized logins to your FortiGate or FortiManager consoles originating from unfamiliar IP addresses in the last 72 hours. Enforce MFA via an external provider if possible.</p>

    <title>Chrome Extension Alert: 16 Malicious Tools Found Stealing ChatGPT Session Tokens</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/28/malicious-chrome-extensions-chatgpt-theft</link>

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Security researchers at Malwarebytes have identified 16 malicious extensions on the Chrome Web Store and Microsoft Edge Add-ons store that specifically target AI users. These extensions "spy" on ChatGPT conversations and steal session tokens, giving attackers full access to chat histories and the ability to prompt on behalf of the user.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Intellectual Property Risk. If employees are using AI to summarize internal documents or write code, these extensions are exfiltrating those "private" prompts to attacker-controlled servers. This effectively bypasses the "Corporate AI" security wrapper.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> These extensions were disguised as helpful productivity tools (e.g., "ChatGPT Enhancer"). They utilize "Man-in-the-Browser" techniques to intercept HTTP headers containing session cookies.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Implement a "Browser Extension Allow-list" for all corporate laptops. Instruct users to immediately uninstall any unverified AI-related extensions and rotate their AI platform passwords.</p>

    <title>Iran Eases Internet Blackout as "Economic Cost" Hits $36M Per Day</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/28/iran-internet-blackout-easing-economic-impact</link>
    <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:15:00 +0300</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/01/28/iran-internet-blackout-easing-economic-impact</guid>
    <description><![CDATA[
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/iran-internet/800/400" alt="A dark map of a region slowly being filled with glowing network lines." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Following the longest recorded internet shutdown in the country's history, Iranian authorities have begun to relax—but not remove—connectivity restrictions. The move follows reports that the blackout was costing the national economy approximately $36 million daily and disrupting essential banking services.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> For businesses in Bahrain and the GCC with regional dependencies, this signals a slow return to operational visibility, though "throttling" and heavy filtering remain in place. It highlights the risk of "Sovereign Disruption" to digital supply chains.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> The regime utilized an "Internet Kill Switch" to quell protests, but the collateral damage to state-aligned industries and financial systems became unsustainable.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Continue to use "Out-of-Band" or satellite-based communication for critical regional updates. Do not rely on standard public internet for high-priority logistics coordination in the region until full stability is confirmed.</p>
