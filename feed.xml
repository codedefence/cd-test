      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Following February's Patch Tuesday, CISA has added six Microsoft zero-days to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. These flaws affect Windows 10, Windows 11, and Microsoft Office, with evidence of active use in state-sponsored espionage and ransomware delivery.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Extreme. These vulnerabilities allow for remote code execution and privilege escalation. For enterprises in Bahrain and the GCC, failure to patch immediately leaves the door open for "Living off the Land" attacks where hackers use legitimate OS tools to stay hidden.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Attackers successfully reverse-engineered previous patches to find unaddressed logic flaws in how Windows handles GDI objects and Office processes OLE documents.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Mandate a 48-hour "Emergency Patching Window" for all Windows workstations and servers. Prioritize Office updates as the primary vector for current phishing campaigns.</p>

    <title>EU Approves Google's $32B Wiz Acquisition: A New Cloud Security Era</title>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/google-wiz/800/400" alt="A Google Cloud logo merging with a golden Wiz shield over a map of Europe." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The European Commission has unconditionally approved Google’s record-breaking $32 billion acquisition of cloud security firm Wiz. The EU ruled that the deal does not raise competition concerns, as Google currently trails Amazon and Microsoft in cloud market share. This move will integrate Wiz’s agentless scanning directly into Google Cloud Platform (GCP).</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> High Market Consolidation. For organizations using multi-cloud strategies, this integration may simplify security on GCP but increases "Vendor Lock-in" risk. Competitors may now move to acquire remaining independent CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) players.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Google is aggressively spending to bridge the trust gap with enterprise clients. By owning the leading cloud-security innovator, they aim to make GCP the "safest" choice for AI workloads.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Review your current cloud security stack. If you use Wiz as an independent auditor for GCP, begin evaluating how the acquisition might affect "neutrality" in cross-cloud reporting (e.g., Wiz scanning Azure/AWS).</p>

    <title>Rockwell Automation Launches AI-Driven Industrial SOC in Singapore</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/11/rockwell-automation-industrial-soc-singapore</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/industrial-soc/800/400" alt="A high-tech monitoring room with industrial refinery icons and glowing AI pulse lines." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Rockwell Automation has launched a new Security Operations Center (SOC) in Singapore to provide 24/7 AI-driven monitoring for industrial customers. The facility focuses on "SecureOT™," aiming to protect the critical convergence of IT and OT (Operational Technology) networks across the Asia-Pacific and beyond.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Critical for Manufacturing and Utilities. As industrial systems become "connected," the risk of physical sabotage via cyber means grows. This regional hub provides a blueprint for how GCC-based industrial giants should centralize OT security monitoring.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> Ransomware attacks on manufacturing rose 37% last year. The shift to "Industry 4.0" has left legacy controllers exposed, necessitating specialized SOCs that understand "industrial protocols" like Modbus and CIP.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> For clients in energy or manufacturing, audit the connectivity between your office network and factory floor. Consider a "Managed OT Detection" model to monitor for anomalies that standard IT firewalls might miss.</p>

    <title>ByteDance "SeedChip" Project: In-House AI Processor to Rivals Nvidia</title>
    <link>https://codedefence.in/blog/2026/02/11/bytedance-seedchip-ai-processor-samsung</link>

      <img src="https://picsum.photos/seed/bytedance-chip/800/400" alt="A digital circuit board with a TikTok-style glitch effect and a Samsung manufacturing seal." style="width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:8px; margin-bottom:12px;" />
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is reportedly developing its own AI chip, code-named "SeedChip." In partnership with Samsung, the company aims to produce 100,000 units this year to reduce reliance on Nvidia. The move follows similar "Silicon Sovereignty" efforts by Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.</p>
      <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Supply Chain Resilience. For tech companies in Bahrain, this suggests a future where AI "compute" becomes more diversified but potentially more fragmented by geopolitical lines. Hardware-level security will become even more critical as custom chips proliferate.</p>
      <p><strong>Why It Happened:</strong> US export controls and Nvidia's 90% market dominance have forced major tech players to design custom silicon optimized for their specific AI models (like TikTok's recommendation engine).</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended Executive Action:</strong> Monitor the "Hardware Provenance" of your AI infrastructure. As custom silicon becomes common, ensure your security audits include hardware-level "Root of Trust" verification for non-Nvidia/Intel chips.</p>
